A school bus driver has been killed while 15
students and two teachers were seriously injured following a suspected bandit
attack in Elgeyo Marakwet on Friday. The bandits, who are believed to have hailed from
Pokot, ambushed the Tot High School bus at the Arror-Mogil road while it
was returning from an educational trip. Confirming the incident, Marakwet East Deputy
Commissioner Simon Osumba said the injured students were rushed to Kapsowar
Mission Hospital and are receiving treatment. The Deputy Commissioner also noted that
police officers have already been deployed to the area to beef up security. Leaders from the region have condemned the
incident as they called on the government to heighten vigilance in the
insecurity prone area.  Elgeyo Marakwet Deputy Governor Wisely Rotich
has since urged the State to address the insecurity issue in the county.
