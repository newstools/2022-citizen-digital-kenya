The Ethics
and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) and the inter-religious
leaders are asking Kenyans to exercise caution during the election and vote
out political leaders implicated in corruption. Speaking on
Monday, EACC CEO Twalib Mbarak said some politicians who have been blocked from
vying were personally calling him in an attempt to corrupt the system. He wondered
why one would struggle to prove they went to school yet they cannot name people
they went to school together with. “Here in
this country, we have people with fake papers and they have the guts to come
and abuse institutions, chest-thumping saying they have degrees. How can you
have a degree and you don't know your classmates,” said Mbarak. He added: “In
this country, we have aggressive crooks fighting the systems. You have a fake
academic paper and you have the guts to call the CEO of EACC to say 'wewe
unanimaliza'. Yes I have been called.”  In a joint communique, the inter-religious leaders now say
they will use their platforms, to sensitize the public on the dangers of
electing people, with questionable credentials.
