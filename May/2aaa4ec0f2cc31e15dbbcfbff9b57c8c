Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru is seeking to
have one of her main rivals barred from competing in the August polls on
grounds of allegedly sabotaging her campaign efforts. The incumbent governor, who is seeking to
defend her seat on a United Democratic Alliance (UDA) party ticket, claims that
the unnamed rival intentionally destroyed her campaign posters in various parts
of Kirinyaga. In a Twitter post on Tuesday, Waiguru stated
that she would file a complaint with the Independent Electoral and Boundaries
Commission (IEBC). “Today I will be lodging an official
complaint to the IEBC through my lawyers to bar my opponent from running for
electoral office for destroying my campaign material, contrary to the Elections
Act 2016 and Elections Conduct,” said the governor. In photographs that accompanied the
aforementioned tweet, one of Waiguru’s campaign posters is seen lying in a
ditch, while another has been turned into a make-shift cover for a motorcycle
shed. Waiguru is poised to lock horns with Charles
Kibiru (Jubilee), Wangui Ngirici (Independent), Muriithi Kagai (Narc Kenya) and
Peter Gitau (Safina). Kirinyaga County was recently in the
headlines following an incident involving youth disrupting political rallies. Six people were arrested last week for
heckling Azimio la Umoja One Kenya coalition party presidential running mate Martha
Karua during her homecoming in the county. The six were arrested for hurling stones at
Karua’s motorcade in Kagumo and Kerugoya. The arrests came after Interior
Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho directed police officers across the country
to launch a crackdown on goons being hired by rogue politicians to
disrupt political events.
