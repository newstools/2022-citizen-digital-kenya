A new law passed by the New York City Council
will require both public and private employers in the state to disclose the
minimum and maximum starting salary for any advertised job, promotion or
transfer opportunity. The law, which takes effect in April 2022,
was passed after 41 council members voted for it while 7 opposed it. Employers who fail to adhere to it will be
deemed to have engaged in discriminatory practices. New York now joins California and Colorado to
become the only states that have introduced pay transparency laws in the Joe
Biden-led nation. Other states are expected to follow in New York’s footsteps. “Lack of salary transparency is
discriminatory and anti-worker. Every New Yorker should have the right to
determine whether they will be able to support themselves and their family when
they apply for a job,” Council member Helen Rosenthal is quoted as saying by
Forbes on the new law. “It is time to level the playing field, and
restore some dignity to New Yorkers seeking employment.” The development follows the passing of a
recent bill in a number of states that barred employers from asking job seekers
how much they earn.  The bill is currently being enforced in a
number of states that are yet to enact the law.
