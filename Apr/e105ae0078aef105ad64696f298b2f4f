Voters in Nandi County effected sweeping
changes in their leadership during the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) party
primaries conducted on April 14, 2022. Only one legislator survived the axe after a
spirited campaign; Tinderet Member of Parliament Julius Melly got a nod from
his constituents to defend his seat in the August polls. Legislators Dr Wilson Kogo (Chesumei), Vincent
Tuwei (Mosop), and Cornelli Serem (Aldai) were all sent packing. In their place, voters preferred new faces which
saw the nomination of Marianne Kitany (Aldai), Paul Biego (Chesumei) and
Abraham Kirwa (Mosop). Little known Josses Lelmengit (35 yrs
old)trounced the former and the sitting women representatives Dr Teclah Tum and
Zipporah Kering to secure nomination to contest Emgwen constituency seat on UDA
ticket. MPs were not the only casualties in the
primaries, as 27 out of 30 Members of County Assemblies were also sent home.  The primaries further saw Nandi Senator
Samson Cherargei  and Governor Stephen
Sang bury their differences and vow to work together to help Deputy President
William Ruto  clinch the presidential
seat.
