The
National Police Service (NPS) has responded to a viral video where a male officer
was captured on camera forcing himself through a vehicle window after what appeared to be a disagreement with the
motorist. In
the video captured by Citizen TV crew on Wednesday afternoon, the policeman
manning the GPO roundabout along Kenyatta Avenue was seen in a heated exchange
with a motorist driving a saloon car in the Nairobi Central Business District (CBD). The officer, during the incident,
which caused a temporary traffic snarl-up, then forced himself into the vehicle
and drove it towards Central Police Station, while the driver fled on foot. In
a statement issued later in the evening, the police service assured the public
that stern action would be taken against the traffic officer. “The
National Police Service has taken note of an incident which has been trending
on social media, whereby a police officer on traffic duties was captured
forcing himself into a private vehicle,” read a statement by the NPS. “The
said officer has been positively identified and is undergoing disciplinary
action.” The
service went further to underscore the conduct of the men in uniform while
undertaking their duties in fulfillment of the law.  “We
reiterate that it is imperative for individual police officers to discharge
their mandate professionally, diligently and with high levels of discipline,”
NPS noted.
