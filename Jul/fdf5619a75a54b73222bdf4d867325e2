 However, speaking to Citizen Digital Transport CS James Macharia said they have not allowed PSVs on the road and any Matatu caught using the road will be apprehended. CS Macharia further stated that they will deploy police officers to ensure PSVs don’t gain access to the road. This now leaves the operators in a state of confusion as they are allowed operations on the road by the operator, Moja express company, while they risk being arrested by police officers for using the road. "We have made sure that all our vehicles meet all the required standards to operate on the road, and yet its only one out of the 5 accidents that occurred along the expressway involved a PSV. We feel that its unfair from the government to do this," says Nelson Mwangi Chairman of Supermetro matatu sacco. According to a source that spoke to Citizen TV, the expressway operator, the Moja Express Company would like the matatus to use the road as they pay much more compared to smaller cars. A PSV using the expressway pays Ksh.1200 compared to a small car and makes frequent trips on the road, between 4-6 a day. Passengers who were using the expressway expressed their delight with the time they save on travel. "The expressway saves a lot of time for us, especially for business people and get back without getting caught in traffic...," says Catherine Njeri, a passenger. To see whether the matatus plying the route comply to the set rules by the government, we boarded one of the buses headed to Kitengela using the expressway. At the Haile Sellasie entry point of the expressway, they were allowed to enter and given a receipt to pay upon reaching the exit. And while on board the driver stuck to a speed limit of 80kph. Fifteen minutes later we were at the Mlolongo exit and here was another requirement by the government already effected which was the erection of rumble strips towards the exit of the road.
