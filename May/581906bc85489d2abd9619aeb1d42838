Police are investigating
the mysterious death of a couple
whose half-naked and lifeless bodies were discovered at lodging in Pipeline,
Embakasi on Monday afternoon. According to the
Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI), the couple checked in at the
establishment in the wee hours of Monday morning after registering with one
Caroline Mbulwa, an attendant at the inn. Mbulwa raised the
alarm after noticing that the couple was yet to check out almost 14 hours after entering the premises. The
pair’s room was also unusually quiet with knocks at the door going unanswered. “Caroline informed
her employer who called in detectives based at DCI Embakasi. The officers broke
into the room only to discover the lifeless bodies of two middle-aged
adults who could not be immediately identified,” said the DCI. Preliminary
investigations show that the couple might have been drugged before retiring to
bed but forensic investigations are currently ongoing to establish the exact
cause of death.  The case will be
handed over to the DCI’s homicide department after forensic investigations are
concluded.
