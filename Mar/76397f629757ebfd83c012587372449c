 According to Mwea-West Sub-county Deputy County Commissioner Peter Nkunga, Mr John Macharia Mwangi the headteacher at Mwea municipality Academy turned the 13-year-old candidate away demanding he clears the outstanding fees. The deputy commissioners said the headteacher was detained at Kiamaciri Police Station for not considering the child's right to education. “He violated those rights. Worse still he didn't consult the Sub-County Director of Education before excluding the pupil from other candidates causing him emotional stress and action will be taken once investigations are completed,” Nkunga said. He added: “It was hard for the candidate to explain the situation because the headteacher was rude and could not listen to him.” The Deputy County Commissioner said while the boy was leaving the school compound frustrated, the Sub-County Director of Education received his complaint and he intervened and the boy was allowed to write his exam 30 minutes late.
