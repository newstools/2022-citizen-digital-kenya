 On Sunday morning, police officers had sealed off the venue after contentions between the two political camps over a double booking of the premise. Police officers lobbed teargas to disperse the crowd that had gathered at the venue, as some were seen pelting stones at the police, with a campaign truck branded in UDA colours parked at the premise. Teargas was seen smoldering as the clash bore on, with scores of people in the audience fleeing from the premise. 2 people were injured and one arrested. The mayhem comes on the backdrop of political undertones as reports revealed that there was a double booking of the premise as both the Kenya Kwanza and Embakasi MP Babu Owino were to hold hold rallies on the same day. Both DP Ruto's team and Azimio, through Embakasi East MP Babu Owino, claimed they had rightfully obtained a green light to conduct their rallies on the aforesaid grounds. Early Sunday morning, police officers were deployed to the venue to manage posible security threats. However, Deputy President William Ruto has insisted on his attendance, ordering his supporters to avail themselves at the venue for their rally. "The Kenya Kwanza fraternity and the entire hustler nation wishes a blessed Sunday to all na tukutane Jacaranda after church," said DP Ruto in a tweet.
