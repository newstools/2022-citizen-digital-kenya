Nairobi County Senator Johnson Sakaja has downplayed the
influence of the Democratic Action Party of Kenya (DAP-K) in the Western region ahead
of the August elections. Senator Sakaja imparted that the Wafula Wamunyinyi led party
was being exploited by the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) Party to frustrate ANC
leader Musalia Mudavadi’s presidential bid and popularity within the Mulembe
nation. “DAP-K is just an ODM in a blue jacket. It is being
bankrolled by them and that’s where the utapeli is,” Sakaja told the
Star in an exclusive interview on Thursday. “If you look at the chairman, Wafula Wamunyinyi, he was of
course being paid by Raila to create problems in Ford Kenya against his
coalition partner in NASA,” he added. The already declared Nairobi Gubernatorial aspirant further alleged of a scheme by the Raila Odinga-led party to cause dissonance in ANC, at the same time linking
the internal strife to the same plot. “It is obvious now. Some people were being paid to create
discord in ANC, we have evidence. They are trying to play down the influence of
Musalia,” he said. "They said in Bukhungu that he is inconsequential; why are
they still talking about him after the earthquake’? If he is inconsequential,
why are they taking politicians from the region to the statehouse?" He posed. Sakaja who during ANC’s delegates conference on Sunday
openly pledged his support to the newly formed alliance between Musalia and Deputy President William Ruto reaffirmed their forthcoming victory.  “The people of Western Kenya will not be lied to. They know
their leadership. Mudavadi has his backing solidly behind him and I don’t think
we will lose more than 10 percent. I think 85% at a minimum will solidly follow
the move he makes,” he said.
