South Member of Parliament Moses Kuria has dismissed claims of working with the
Azimio la Umoja movement ahead of the August General Elections. The
vocal MP spoke on Tuesday during the burial of former Kiambu Governor Ferdinand
Waititu’s mother, Monica Njeri Waititu. The
Chama Cha Kazi (CCK) party leader maintained that under no circumstance would
he even think about joining the impending Azimio la Umoja grand coalition. According
to Kuria, his differences with the Azimio team are only ideological and not
personal, hence should not be mistaken for enmity with anyone. “Mimi
niko upande wa Mungu...hiyo ndio upande haiwezi niangusha…hakuna siku mimi
utanipata kwa Azimio. Ata nikikufa msinipeleke Azimio…Niko kwa Chama Cha Kazi
(CCK) sina ubaya na mtu,” he said. The
MP at the same time urged Central region leaders to rally their support behind
Narc-Kenya party leader Martha Karua, whom they – under the umbrella of Mt.
Kenya Unity Forum – last year elected as their spokesperson. He
stated that Karua was well vested with political experience and was capable of
leading. “Sisi
wanaume wenye tuko hapa tunatosha mboga....Rigathi Gachagua anaweza, Kindiki
anaweza, lakini wacha huyu mama Karua atuongoze atuonyeshe njia,” Kuria said. This
comes after Kuria on Sunday held a meeting with One Kenya Alliance (OKA) co-principals;
Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Martha Karua (NARC-K),
Cyrus Jirongo (UDP) and KANU Executive Director George Wainaina
representing party boss Gideon Moi.  “Whereas
we share many ideals between Chama Cha Kazi and OKA, we agreed to work
together  as long as OKA is not joining the Azimio Coalition which is
incompatible with me and the Chama Cha Kazi Party,” he said.
