 Some 293 girls who were rescued from Female Genital Mutilation in the past one month in the Kuria region of Migori County have been reunited with the families after the cut period ended on December 28. The girls who were taking refuge at Nyangoge and Sakuri rescue camps were released on Saturday after the government and the anti-crusaders established that they are now safe. Mabera Sub-county children officer Janet Robi said the girls had run away from their homes in fear of ‘the cut’. Robi said the parents were sensitised on FGM before being allowed to pick up their daughters from the rescue camps. Meanwhile, over 40 girls who were arrested after undergoing the cut are still detained at various children home as cases against their parents who have been arrested for abetting FGM remain active in court. Robi said the girls who underwent ‘the cut’ were awaiting presentation before the court as exhibits, adding that releasing them might interfere with the cases. Just two weeks ago, two parents in Kuria region were slapped with six-year jail terms after they were found guilty of abetting FGM.
