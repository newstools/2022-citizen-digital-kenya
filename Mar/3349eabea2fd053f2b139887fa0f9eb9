The Green Congress of Kenya (GCK) party has
become the latest local political outfit to support ODM leader Raila Odinga’s
presidential bid ahead of the August polls. The party, whose political ideology is
founded on ecological sustenance, opted to back the Azimio la Umoja movement
flag bearer following a resolution by its National Governing Council (NGC) on
Saturday. “Indeed, we are convinced that the
stewardship of the deepening of the gains in implementing our new progressive Constitution
as a country must safely be in the hands of the person who has demonstrated the
greatest passion and commitment to its promulgation and implementation, Raila
Amollo Odinga,” GCK co- party leader Martin Ogindo said in a statement. He also alluded that the March 2018 handshake
between Odinga and President Uhuru Kenyatta played a part in informing the
council’s decision citing that by setting aside his differences with the Head of
State, the ODM leader demonstrated that he had the country’s best interest at
heart. Mr. Ogindo termed the handshake with as “an
epochal gesture that has united us as a nation and given this country the right
political environment to build on a more genuine peace that we direly need for Economic
Liberation.” He likewise stated that GCK will field
candidates to contest for all other elective positions that will be contested
for at the ballot. “We aim at significant representation in the
various seats available under the Constitution,” said the former Rangwe MP. During the NGC, the party announced changes
