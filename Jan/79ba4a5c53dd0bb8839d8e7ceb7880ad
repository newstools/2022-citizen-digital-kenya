 Two bodies were found in a forest in Hindi, Lamu County on
Thursday morning. Police said the bodies are of two people who were abducted
by suspected Al-Shabaab terrorists eight days ago in the Kibokoni area. Locals have since moved out of their homes in the area, with
some forced to spend the night in the forest in fear of attacks. The worrying state of security in Lamu saw heavy deployment
of security in a bid to ward off any impending attacks from both Al-Shabaab
militants and bandits. Students have also been forced to leave school even as
parents appeal to the government to address the matter and contain the
situation. Four police officers were on January 7 killed in a suspected
Al-Shabaab attack at Milihoi area after the militants reportedly attacked a
police convoy in the area. Meanwhile, the latest bandit attack, the fifth this month,
left one person injured and several houses torched despite an ongoing
high-level multi-agency operation in the Coastal town’s mainland.  The attacks which are targeting specific Lamu villages have
notably been escalating in the past three weeks leaving more than 10 people
dead and property destroyed.
