 The Kenya National Highways Authority (KenHA) has announced that a section of the Thika-Garissa road will be closed off to motorists for 76 days to allow for ongoing constructions. The road’s closure, KenHA says, will commence on January 19 and end on April 5, 2022, to allow for the construction of a Box Culvert along Kathuluni river area of Machakos County “Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA), in pursuant to the Traffic Act Cap. 403 Section 71, wishes to notify the general public that a section of Thika - Garissa (A3) Road will be closed due to the ongoing construction,” KenHA said in a notice on Tuesday. Motorists have since been urged to adhere to instructions given by traffic marshals on alternative areas surrounding the construction area. “Motorists will use the diversion provided and are requested to exercise caution around the work areas, follow the traffic management plan, and the directions given by the traffic marshals,” KenHA added.
