 Joseph Kiplimo is said to have sold a sheep belonging to his 24-year-old wife and when asked why he misused the money, he went berserk and murdered her. According to neighbours, the two have had differences in the past, but this time it was about money. "He was angry when he was confronted by the wife about why he misused the money after selling the sheep," said Kelvin Kosgei. Jane Amekwe, mother to the deceased was at pains, saying she was shocked by the heinous act. "He has been drinking a lot of late and coming home drunk. He has threatened my daughter always," said Amakwe. Area chief assistant Hezekiah Ruto confirmed the incident, asking those in marriage to persevere and resolve issues by seeking help from others.
