 During the party's National Delegates Conference at the Bomas of Kenya on Monday, Wanjigi reiterated his commitment to seeking the country's top job thanking his party members for endorsing him. "I want to thank the delegates and party members for the honour bestowed on me as the presidential candidate. With humility I accept the nomination, asanteni sana," he said. "I accept this task with deep obligation and an unshakeable resolve and complete dedication, all the while being aware of its burdens and decisions. Together we will form a firm foundation." Wanjigi also outlined his manifesto, saying that his government will, among other things,  provide free education from the pre-primary level up to the secondary school level. "We commit to take the time to rebuild our country after the flood of corruption and inequity. We will ensure that every Kenyan exercises their right to live a decent and dignified life as enshrined in article 43 of our constitution," he said. Our goal is very clear, we are an instrument of transformational and systemic change. It is our resolve to give our country a different leadership to resolve progressive irreversible gains in our governance. Wanjigi, if elected president, also plans to deal with wanton graft, as well as increase Kenya's agricultural yield by moving away from rain fed agriculture to a stable irrigation system. Deputy President William Ruto also attended the event flanked by some of his Kenya Kwanza Alliance counterparts among them Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua and former Bomet governor Isaac Ruto. Wanjigi ditched ODM and joined Safina in early March. He has since maintained that he has not given up on his presidential bid.
