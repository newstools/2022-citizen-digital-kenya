 Jill Justiniani and Erin Cheplak, both 30, gave birth to their first sons at the Kaiser Permanente hospital in Anaheim, in an unusual occurrence. Astoundingly, each of the sons, Oliver (Justiniani’s) and Silas (Cheplak’s), each weighed 7 pounds and 3 ounces at birth. They were also each 20 inches long. "Sharing our pregnancy together was really special because we really had the support of each other through every step of the process," Justiniani told Good Morning America. "Even just going through the day-to-day changes of pregnancy, all of the unknowns and the questions and the natural worries that come up, we were constantly able to check in with each other and support each other." The sisters, who work as pediatric occupational therapists at the same outpatient clinic, married about a year apart. Cheplak's water broke 10 days before she was due, despite the fact that they became pregnant within eight days of each other. Justiniani's C-section was scheduled for May 5 on the same day.
