A Citizen TV pick-up truck was on Sunday pelted with stones by rowdy youth while covering Deputy President William Ruto’s rally in Jacaranda Grounds in Pipeline, Nairobi. According to reporters who were aboard the truck, the vehicle was among several others that bore the brunt of Sunday's rally mayhem as it snaked its way from the chaos. The chaotic rally was momentarily halted after a rival group opposed to the gathering raided the venue and started pelting attendees with stones. Several videos showed police officers lobbing teargas to disperse the crowd that had gathered at the venue as scores of people in the audience fled from the dais where the second in command was. Amid the disarray, DP Ruto said if elected president, his government would do away with the culture of throwing stones. The situation appeared to have been contained until the DP finished speaking and it was time to leave the grounds. The rowdy youth are said to have resumed pelting stones as the vehicles left, shattering windows and denting vehicles’ bodies.
