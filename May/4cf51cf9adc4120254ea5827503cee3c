Police in Kericho are holding in custody a
matatu tout over alleged incitement to election-related violence after
threatening vendors with ejection from the county after the August polls. The suspect, Kipruto Vincent Koech, was nabbed
following a report where he was accused of propagating violence and threatening
vendors due to their different political affiliations. According to a Directorate of Criminal
Investigations (DCI) report on Saturday, Koech had parked his vehicle to block
the said vendors from carrying out their businesses. “As the vendors asked the matatu driver to
give them some space to attend to their customers, the tout shouted them
down telling them that their days in the county were numbered, as they would be
ejected before the forthcoming general elections,” read the statement. Alarmed by the threats, DCI explained, the
vendors who have operated in the space for nearly 20 years, while fearing for
their lives, went and filed complaints at Kericho Police Station. Sleuths arrested the suspect and he is presently
behind bars awaiting arraignment.
