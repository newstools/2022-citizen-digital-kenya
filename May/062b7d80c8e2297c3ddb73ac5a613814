Terry Ramadhani Kiunge has been appointed as the
new Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (KEMSA) Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Kiunge will, effective immediately, take over
from the authority’s acting CEO John Kibuchi while replacing outgoing boss Dr.
Jonah Manjari, whose contract expires next month. The new KEMSA CEO will be tasked with
spearheading the State agency as it seeks to introduce reforms geared towards
guaranteeing ethical and cost-effective operations in the local public health
space. The authority, in a statement to newsrooms,
said Kiunge emerged as the best candidate during a recruitment exercise undertaken
by the board in conjunction with Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and
Technology Consulting Services’ (JKUATES) executive selection experts. The recruitment and evaluation exercise has
been ongoing since March 2022. “Several applicants expressed an interest in
serving as the KEMSA CEO during the envisaged organisational transformation
phase that is now underway. At the evaluation stage, Ms Kiunge emerged as the
best candidate,” noted KEMSA. “In Ms Kiunge, the KEMSA Board is confident
that the organisational transformation agenda will be sustained and
professionally executed.” Prior to her appointment, Kiunge served at
Aga Khan University as the HR and Global Change Director. She has previously worked as a senior director
at the President’s Delivery Unit (PDU) where she was in charge of monitoring
and evaluating support for several national government health pillar flagship
projects, such as the Universal Health Coverage. The new KEMSA CEO holds a Masters in Business
Administration (MBA) from the University of Liverpool, a Bachelor of Education
degree from Kenyatta University and an Adaptive Leadership Certification from
the Harvard Kennedy School.  She is also a certified project management
professional and a member of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and
Development (CIPD).
