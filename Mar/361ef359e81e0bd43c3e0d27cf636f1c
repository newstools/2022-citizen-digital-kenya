President Uhuru Kenyatta on Saturday hosted a
delegation of Gikuyu elders and a section of political leaders from the Central
Kenya region at State House, Nairobi. Citizen Digital has since learnt that a
number of resolutions were passed at the hushed meeting, key among them being the
affirmation of President Kenyatta as the community leader; a mantle he was
first handed on November 30, 2012. Sources within the room said the Head of State
was asked to lead the community in political negotiations with a view to its
inclusion in the next government, as his term comes to an end. The President challenged relatively smaller political
parties in the region to work with Jubilee in the interest of the community, so
as to avoid splitting votes. Parties in the region allied to the ruling
Jubilee Party and Azimio la Umoja were also tasked with mobilising voter
turnout for ODM chief Raila Odinga as their presidential candidate of choice. President Kenyatta said the region must
produce enough legislators in both chambers of Parliament as a tool of
representation and collectivity in safeguarding its interests, particularly on
revenue sharing and lawmaking. According to the sources, President Kenyatta
further reportedly explained his friction with his deputy William Ruto and what
led to his now-infamous March 9, 2018 handshake with his then political rival
Odinga.  He also praised Mt. Kenya MPs such as Jeremiah
Kioni (Ndaragwa), and Kanini Kega (Kieni), as well as leaders like Agriculture CS Peter Munya and NARC Kenya boss Martha Karua who he said have stood with him
and Jubilee Party through the turbulence, as others shifted their allegiance to
DP Ruto.
