Kisumu County government, through the city
department, has now issued a notice banning all political activities within the
Central Business District (CBD). Kisumu City Manager Abala Wanga issued the
notice saying no politician will be allowed to hold a political rally within
the city centre. According to Wanga, the move has been
occasioned by the destruction of public property that happens during such
rallies. Wanga says most of the rally-goers vandalize
public property within the CBD, thereby hurting efforts to refurbish the face
of the city through beautification programs. He says the city shall designate areas of
campaigns outside the city centre, further adding that those violating the
notice will face the law. In the run-up to the Africities summit, the
city also banned the erection of political billboards and posters within the
CBD until the end of the event. This comes as former Kisumu Governor Jack
Ranguma was on Friday expected to hold a rally in the CBD to unveil his bid to
unseat incumbent county boss Prof. Anyang Nyong’o.
