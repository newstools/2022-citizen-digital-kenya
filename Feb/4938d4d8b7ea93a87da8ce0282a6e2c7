 Speaking at the launch of the Universal Health Coverage program in Changamwe on Monday, Atwoli said there are individuals in the government who want workers in the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) and the National Social Security Fund (NSSF) to be fired and should be cut off from their positions. He argued that workers should receive their dues as they are the major contributors to the social welfare of the institutions. "I am a social partner to the NHIF and the big chunk of the money comes from workers, assured monthly contributions," he posed. "And there is a school of thought somewhere in the government that workers must be alienated from NHIF and NSSF, you should know the powers of workers," he added. The COTU boss further urged the government to "sober up and sit down" to ensure that workers, who are already opting to go work overseas, will be assured of their salary and security in service. "I would urge us to sober up, sit down and see whether these professionals can remain under our national government so that they are assured of their salary. We don't want to lose our young doctors," he said.
