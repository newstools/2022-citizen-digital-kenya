 Karaba is looking to recapture his seat which he lost to current governor Charles Kibiru who has declared his intention to oust current governor Anne Waiguru, at the August polls, under a UDA ticket.  Interior PS Karanja Kibicho welcomed him to the party during an event held in Kagio, Kirinyaga County on Saturday.  When making the announcement, Karaba stated that his decision was informed in part by the fact that TSP lacked a clear political direction and that the outfit’s hierarchy had blatantly disrespected President Uhuru Kenyatta on a number of occasions.  He similarly drummed up support for his governorship bid by reiterating that he has a proven track record of making significant changes that have positively influenced the lives ofKenyans, owing to his stint as chairman of the Senate Education Committee, a position he held during his time as Kirinyaga senator.  “When I was the chairman of Senate Education Committee I initiated many day secondary schools. Several people from the region were also employed as teachers through my influence and residents should reciprocate by giving their votes to me," he said according to the Nation.  PS Kibicho on his part lauded Karaba’s move while urging other politicians in the region to join Jubilee. He likewise urged Karaba to solicit support for ODM frontman Raila Odinga’s presidential bid.  The PS likewise dismissed allegations that he was allegedly threatening Mt. Kenya leaders who have opted to back Deputy President William Ruto in the race to state house citing that every person in the country is constitutionally free to back any political outfit of his choosing.
