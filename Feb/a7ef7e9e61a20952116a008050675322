 Exuding confidence that UDA would clinch victory, dismissed claims that the newly-formed Kenya Kwanza coalition between his UDA, ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetangula of Ford Kenya needed Kalonzo's backing to win the August polls. “I want to ask Kalonzo to stop pretending that UDA is
looking for him for talks. At the Kenya Kwanza alliance and UDA, we are
contented working with Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetang’ula,” Muthama said in
an interview with the Standard on Wednesday.  “We are confident we will win the upcoming election,” he added. In the past weeks, UDA leader Deputy President William Ruto has previously wooed Kalonzo to team up with him together with the One Kenya Alliance to increase their chances of
victory in the August polls. “Kalonzo Musyoka and I have a lot in common. That's why we
should team up to form the next government," DP Ruto said while on a tour
at Makueni County in January.  Despite the calls by the Kenya Kwanza team to Kalonzo to
join their camp, he has been adamant outrightly stating that his OKA team will
field a presidential candidate come August.
