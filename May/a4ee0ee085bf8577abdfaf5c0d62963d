The Employment and Labor Relations court has
quashed the appointment of three Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (KEMSA) board
members by Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe last year. The court said the appointment of (Rtd)
Lawrence Wahome, Terry Kiunge Ramadhani and Linton Nyaga Kinyua as members of
the authority’s Board of Directors was not done in accordance with the Constitution. The court however dismissed a case by the
Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU) over
alleged looming mass firing at KEMSA. The union argued that KEMSA had threatened to
undertake mass sacking of its more than 900 staff members and purported to
enlist new staff from the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) and the National Youth
Service (NYS) contrary to the provisions of the Constitution. Lady Justice Maureen Onyango said the
petitioners did not table evidence in court to show that there were KDF or NYS
officers at the KEMSA premises.  The court further ruled that the application was
speculative and pre-emptive stating that none of KMPDU's members could have been declared redundant.
