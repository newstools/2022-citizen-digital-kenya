 The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) said this is because the Horn of Africa region is experiencing the driest conditions recorded since 1981. The situation is compounded by three consecutive failed rainy seasons that have not only decimated crops but also caused abnormally high livestock deaths. This has affected communities living in south-eastern and northern Kenya, southern and south-eastern Ethiopia, and south-central Somalia. According to WFP, water shortages and lack of pasture are forcing families from their homes and leading to increased conflict between communities. "Harvests are ruined, livestock are dying, and hunger is growing as recurrent droughts affect the Horn of Africa," said Michael Dunford, Regional Director in the WFP Regional Bureau for Eastern Africa. "The situation requires immediate humanitarian action and consistent support to build the resilience of communities for the future." Further forecasts of below-average rainfall are threatening to worsen and compound dire conditions in the coming months. Following this, WFP has appealed for assistance in order to avoid a major humanitarian crisis, like the one the world witnessed in 2011 when 250,000 people died of hunger in Somalia.
