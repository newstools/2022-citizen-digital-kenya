President Uhuru Kenyatta has joined fellow
world leaders in mourning Japan's former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe who died on
Friday after being shot at a political campaign meeting. The President expressed shock at the former
Japanese leader's sudden demise and termed him a dear friend and development
ally of the Kenyan nation. "It is utterly shocking and somewhat
unbelievable to learn of the death of my friend, and one of Kenya's foremost
development allies, former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, in a savage shooting
incident," President Kenyatta mourned.  Former Prime Minister Abe, who retired in
2020, visited Nairobi in 2016 during the 6th TICAD conference, during which he
held bilateral talks with President Kenyatta at State House, Nairobi.
