The
Martha Karua-led NARC Kenya party has now requested for additional 7 days to go
through the draft One Kenya Alliance (OKA) coalition agreement. The
party's National Executive Committee said it will need the stated period to
review the terms of the agreement before penning the deal. NARC-Kenya,
in a statement by Secretary General Orwa Michael on Tuesday evening, said the
additional time will be critical in assessing the contract and closely
examining it before a decision is made. “The
National Executive Committee (NEC) resolved that it needs more time to familiarize
and scrutinize the Coalition Agreement and related documentation,” said Mr.
Orwa. “The Party's Legal Team is instructed to seek
clarity on any and existing grey areas, prepare and present a detailed brief to
NEC and shall meet within the next 7 days for final approval.” The
OKA allied parties; Wiper, Narc-Kenya, UDP and KANU, were initially scheduled to
sign the coalition agreement on Wednesday. However,
Mr. Orwa explained that among the reasons for NARC-Kenya’s request for postponement
included the recent amended Political Parties Act which he said called for
legal interpretations and more scrutiny. “The
party appreciates in equal weight the pressing timelines for critical
decision-making, and the need to move both expeditiously and in accordance with
the Law,” he stated.  While
assuring the commitment of party leader Martha Karua and the other three OKA co-principals,
NARC-Kenya reaffirmed its decision to form coalitions with other partners with
similar political ideologies.
