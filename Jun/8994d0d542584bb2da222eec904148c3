 According to the hospital’s management, they have been receiving numerous queries from people who want to trade their kidneys. 'How much for my kidney?' is our most inboxed question,” the hospital said on its social media handles on Monday evening. KNH has however clarified that the sale of kidneys, and all organs, remains illegal in the country, and one can only donate out of free will. “Please note that organ sale is strictly prohibited and illegal. You can only donate out of free will,” said the hospital.  Although illicit in many countries across the world, kidney trade is among the most lucrative clandestine trades, with brokers using social media to find donors. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), South Asia is the leading transplant tourism hub globally, with India among the top kidney exporters. It is estimated that more than 2,000 Indians sell their kidneys every year, most of which go to foreigners. An alarming surge in renal diseases, diabetes and high blood pressure is driving the global demand for kidneys, which greatly exceeds the legal supply. As a result, India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Iran have become the world’s biggest black market for organs. Blood plasma, sperms and hair are some of the other organs which fetch a lot of money.
