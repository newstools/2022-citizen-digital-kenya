 This is despite the law dictating that one loses his seat when he resigns from the party that sponsored him/her to Parliament. According to Article 103(e) of the Constitution, “a member who resigns from their party loses their seat." However, according to Nderitu, there is a gap in the law, that will allow the current Members of the National Assembly and the Senate to continue serving despite the fact that they would have ditched parties that sponsored them. This will come as a huge relief to over 150 MPs that are expected to be moving from one party to another in readiness for the August 9th general elections. “It’s safe to say that before that date of 26th March then anybody that wants to participate on the ticket of that particular party must have joined, the law also says clearly that 3 months before a general election, no by-elections can be held,” Nderitu said. This effectively means that MPs that will defect by 26th March will continue dispensing their duties as members of Parliament despite having ditched parties that sponsored them to Parliament. Nderitu also assured political parties that her office will be ready to facilitate nominations when the time comes, dismissing fears that her office is incapacitated. She says they are ready to give political parties register up to the polling station level, to enable parties to conduct free and fair nominations. “Over the last few years we have improved our systems making sure that we are efficient and we provide information as required, so there is no cause for worry, and we are engaging political parties to know exactly how we will present information to them, but we have the capacity,” Nderitu said. The registrar was quick to emphasize that they will not be conducting nominations for parties, but only facilitating to ensure free and fair nominations. Political parties will conduct nominations between 16 and 22nd of April this year.
