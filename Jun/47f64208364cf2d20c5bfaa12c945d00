 According to statistics from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), of the 190 confirmed cases as of May 31, only two were women. Additionally, 111 cases are males known to be gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men. The findings also showed that 86% of the cases comprised London residents. “Monkeypox can affect anyone but we know that many of the most recent diagnoses are in gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, many of whom live in, or have links to London,” Sky News quoted Prof. Kevin Fenton, London’s regional director for public health, as saying. "As with any new disease outbreak, the risk of stigma and uncertainty is great. This is why we're working side by side with the NHS, sexual health, voluntary and community sector organisations in London to share accurate information about Monkeypox, especially to people and groups at increased risk through representative voices." UKHSA said that so far, investigations have identified monkeypox links to gay bars, saunas, and the use of dating apps in the UK and abroad. This comes even as the World Health Organization acknowledges over 550 confirmed monkeypox cases worldwide as of Tuesday. Over the weekend, WHO said it had received reports of 1,365 cases and 69 monkeypox deaths in five African countries where monkeypox is commonly found. The organization said the illnesses were reported in various periods ranging from mid-December to late May. However, no deaths had been reported in nonendemic countries.
