Armed officers on Monday night raided businessman Jimi Wanjigi's offices at General Mathenge drive in Westlands, Nairobi. The unknown number of officers arrived at the Kwacha Group of Companies offices at around 9.30pm on Monday. Images grabbed from CCTV footage and shared on social media showed several armed officers standing outside the gate of Wanjigi's offices ostensibly waiting to gain access. Sources told Citizen Digital that Wanjigi was holed up at the offices together with his son and several staff members. The motive behind the night raid remains unclear.
