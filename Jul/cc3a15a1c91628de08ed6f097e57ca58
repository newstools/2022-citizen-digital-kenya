 According to police, Bupe Chipando, alias Elena, was arrested by detectives after allegedly defrauding a Dutch National over Ksh.170 million in a fake gold deal. Mr. Chipando had also been previously linked with the printing of counterfeit currency. Interior Cabinet Secretary Dr. Fred Matiang’i issued deportation orders on the suspect who was ejected from the country some minutes before midnight. “Bupe, who was also involved in counterfeit printing currency, was deported at 1145hrs today, following orders issued by the Cabinet Secretary for Interior, Dr Fred Matiang’i,” the Directorate of Criminal Investigations said on Sunday, July 10. His deportation comes a month after a Sudanese man said to be an “international fugitive” was flushed out of his hideout at the University of Nairobi’s staff quarters. Detectives on June 7 said they had established that Mohamed Nagi Mohamed Magzoub, who was in possession of a Sudanese passport, is facing organised crime charges in the country. At the time, the government said arrangements to extradite the suspect to Khartoum were underway.
