 Kuria, the Chama Cha Kazi Party's leader, told Citizen TV on Sunday that the exclusion from Kenya Kwanza allies, as well as the unfair treatment, appear to affect only parties from Central Kenya. He claimed that while Mudavadi's ANC and Wetangula's Ford-Kenya parties were allowed to plan Kenya Kwanza rallies in Western Kenya, UDA organized the meetings in Kiambu, where Kuria is seeking governorship mandate, and Kuria's CCK and Kabogo's Tujibebe Wakenya parties were excluded. "When it comes to planning meetings in Mt. Kenya, they are held exlusively by UDA and we are locked out, for me it is sad and strange," Kuria said. "Even when it comes to the campaign team called Hustler Express which is my brainchild, when they come to Kiambu, we are locked out," Kuria claims that the Kenya Kwanza alliance exists in the rest of the country but quickly becomes UDA in Central Kenya and Kiambu counties. He claimed they were now dealing with the same 'political deceit and conmanship' issues that drove them to leave the Jubilee party. At the same time, Kuria downplayed claims that his CCK party lacks the clout of the parties it claims received preferential treatment. With 231 candidates running for various elective seats in August, Kuria believes his party should not be considered small and should be given an audience to compete with other parties that have also fielded candidates. "Do you know my party CCK has 231 candidates eyeing various seats... across the country, what business can you tell me that this party is dominant, this party, why not give our candidates the chance?" Kuria posed "UDA has rubbished opinion polls, why not wait for 50 days, if we are that insignificant why invite us to the coalition,"
