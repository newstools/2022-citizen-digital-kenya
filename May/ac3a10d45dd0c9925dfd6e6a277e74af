 NMS, in a tweet on Wednesday, said that Public Service Vehicle (PSVs) plying Ngong and Argwings Kodhek roads will be the first to be affected. PSVs plying Lang'ata road will follow on May 27th. "Starting 24th May 2022, all PSVs plying Ngong' road and Argwings Kodhek road will pick and drop passengers at the Green Park Bus Terminal," NMS wrote. "Starting 27th May 2022, all PSVs plying Lang'ata road will pick and drop passengers at the Green Park Bus Terminal." NMS says the terminal will accommodate between 300 and 350 vehicles at a go, and up to 20,000 in a day. The Green Park coordinating committee had earlier warned unscrupulous individuals to stay away from the park after some individuals were caught planning to sell parking spots to matatu SACCOs. There will, however, be six city link buses to ferry commuters who do not wish to walk to the city centre, with more expected to be introduced as demand increases. The facility, however, has seen its completion date pushed forward severally, as the organization had promised to commission operations in April.
