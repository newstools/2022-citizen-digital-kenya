 According to Kathurumu area residents, Stanley Nadangwi was jailed for 14 years in prison for chopping off someone’s hand and has recently returned home after completing his sentence. In what is said to be a disagreement over family land, he had killed his brothers in separate incidents in December and January then gone into hiding. Nadangwi reportedly chopped off his brother's hand on January 25 and he succumbed to the injuries. He is said to have vowed to wipe off his family members, including his grandparents. The area chief says Nadangwi has been roaming around wielding a machete but it is suspected that he has informers who are aiding him by food and information to evade arrest. Police in association with Nyumba Kumi officials have launched a manhunt for the convict.
