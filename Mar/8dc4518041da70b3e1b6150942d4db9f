National
Youth Service (NYS) scandal suspect Ben Gethi has been sentenced to five years
in jail after being found guilty of forging documents for a Ksh. 105 million
tender in the 2013 elections. Gethi
was also slapped with an alternative fine of Ksh.4 million fine. He
was convicted alongside his company co-director Joyce Makena as well as former
Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) officers Kennedy Ochae,
Willie Gachanja, and Gabriel Mutunga. “The
five accused persons, on diverse dates between October 22, 2012 and November
23, 2012 at IEBC offices, anniversary towers colluded to change the price
schedule submitted by Solarmak Technologies for the supply of solar lanterns
for the March 2013 General Elections, to facilitate the award of the said
tender to Solarmak Technologies Ltd, a Company co- owned by Benson Gethi
Arangui and Joyce Makena,” Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Noordin Haji
said in a statement. Ochae
and Mutunga were found guilty of changing a tender document contrary to the
Constitution. Mutunga
was handed a two-year sentence with the option of paying a Ksh.2.8 million fine
to avoid imprisonment. Gethi,
Makena and Solarmark Technologies were also charged with issuing a false tax
compliance certificate to IEBC. Gethi
and Makena were ordered to pay a Ksh.1.5 million fine or serve a two-year jail
sentence. They were similarly ordered to pay Ksh. 500,000 each for being
directors of Solarmark. Anti-corruption
court Chief Magistrate Lawrence Mugambi on Monday found the four guilty saying
the prosecution had proven the case beyond reasonable doubt. “The
aim was to lie to IEBC that the said company was qualified to participate in
that tender while it was not,” ruled the magistrate.  “The
two uttered the documents which they knew were false the prosecution has proved
beyond reasonable doubt failure to comply with the law relating procurement.”
