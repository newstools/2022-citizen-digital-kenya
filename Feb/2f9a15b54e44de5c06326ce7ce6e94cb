Gatundu South Member of Parliament Moses
Kuria has officially declared his interest in the Kiambu gubernatorial seat
ahead of the August General Elections. The lawmaker announced that he had joined the
race for the county’s top job on his social media platforms on Saturday. “Vox
Populi, Vox Dei meaning 'the voice of the people is the voice of
God' So help me God. Under your wings, I feel safe. Mungu mbele,” Kuria wrote on Facebook. Kuria is set to battle for the seat under his
Chama Cha Kazi (CCK) party ticket. He will be facing off with incumbent Governor
James Nyoro, Senator Kimani Wamatangi, County Assembly Speaker Stephen Ndichu,
Thika MP Jungle Wainaina, as well as former governors Ferdinand Waititu and
William Kabogo. Since his return to the country early this
month, Kuria had dismissed interests of vying for the seat saying he was only
focusing on his party’s affairs. "My current single-minded focus is to
help Chama Cha Kazi win as many Governor, Senator, Women Rep, National Assembly
and MCA seats as possible,” Kuria said in an interview with the Standard on February
18, 2022.  The MP had been admitted to the American
Hospital in Dubai since last year where he underwent surgery after
sustaining third-degree burns from a malfunctioning heating mat.
