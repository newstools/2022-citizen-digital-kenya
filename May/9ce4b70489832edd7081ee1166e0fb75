 Auma will be contesting on a United Democratic Alliance (UDA) party ticket and becomes the sixth aspirant to join the race after Mary Ojode of DAP-K, Joyce Osogo of ODM, Molline Ngala, Tabitha Nyandiek and Elizabetb Ogweno, who are all independent candidates. Speaking on Monday in Homa Bay Town after she was issued with a direct UDA nomination ticket to vie for the position, Auma said she will focus on empowering youths and women in the county through various economic programmes should she clinch the seat. “Homa Bay people are suffering, from the boda boda sector to mama mbogas are feeling the effects of the harsh economy while the leaders engage in corruption,” she said. She further stated that if elected, she will introduce policies that will empower women and small-scale traders. Auma is among a few aspirants who have dared to venture into a political arena in the area that is dominated by the Raila Odinga-led Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party. She argued that her decision to choose UDA is based on her love for the party leader, Deputy President William Ruto, and his bottom-up economic model. At the same time, she vowed to drum up support for her bid and that of Dr. Ruto so that he could be elected the fifth president of Kenya.
