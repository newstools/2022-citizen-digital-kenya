 The petitioner; Salesio Mutuma Thuranira; a Nairobi resident, is now seeking orders stopping the operationalization of the said Bill arguing that the bill threatens the political rights of Kenyans and independence of the electoral commission IEBC. He also wants the court to issue orders barring the IEBC and the Registrar of  Political Parties from implementing and or acting on the Political Parties (Amendment) Act, 2021. Through lawyer Elias Mutuma, the petitioner argues that the Bill was passed in the National Assembly without being subjected to public participation. The petitioner maintains that the Bill as passed contradicts the constitutional definition of a political party. “The Bill as passed seeks to grant the Registrar of Political Parties draconian powers that would materially and substantially assail due process guarantees under the Constitution... THAT, the Bill as passed is fraught with ambiguity and will lead to confusion in the electoral system…,” reads the court documents. The matter has been filed under a certificate of urgency. Respondents in the case include the Attorney General, Speaker of National Assembly, Senate, the Registrar of Political Parties and IEBC.
