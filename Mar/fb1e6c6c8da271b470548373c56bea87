Detectives based in Naivasha have arrested a 32-year old man
who allegedly killed his 26-year-old wife and dumped her body at
Kongoni area in Nakuru County. The suspect, Julius Owaka, was being trailed by DCI sleuths following
the discovery of decomposing remains of his wife Wanjiru in January 2022. A statement from the Directorate of Criminal Investigation (DCI) revealed that Owaka was nabbed by the DCI sleuths in conjunction with Crime
Research and Intelligence Bureau (CRIB) on Monday evening at Githurai 45 in Nairobi. “Through forensic cyber and digital analysis, the sleuths
traced the suspect to Githurai 45, where he had since gone into hiding, after
committing the crime,” read the report. “Yesterday evening, sleuths combed the populous Githurai 45,
before fishing out Julius Owaka, from his hideout.” DCI explained that the once-married couple who had lived in
Duro area for five years had constant marriage squabbles which led to a breakup in 2022. “The two had lived together for
five years before differences started rocking their blissful union, leading to
irreconcilable differences that led to their separation last year,” stated DCI. The woman is then said to have opted to move back to her parents’
home which is a few kilometres away. Thereafter, the suspect, a football player at a local flower
farm soccer club, is said to have begun making advances to the deceased in a bid to
rekindle the troubled marriage. DCI further said that Muthoni fell for the charms of her former
husband and the reunion led to her brutal murder. "Unaware that she was being lured to a death trap, the
deceased left her father’s compound on January 31, not to be seen again, until
her decomposing remains were discovered 9 days later in a thicket within Duro
area, three kilometres from her father’s home,” noted the DCI.
