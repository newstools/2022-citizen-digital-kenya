 According to court papers obtained by Citizen Digital, the woman is seeking a monthly maintenance of Ksh.448,450. The sum will cover expenses such as food and shopping, rent, security, clothing and housekeeping, entertainment, medical coverage, education, transportation, and utilities. “Mr Sonko and I are the biological parents of the minor herein,” the court papers, from the case filed at the Senior Principal Magistrate at Ngong read. “Mr Sonko has always been defiant and brazen to accept responsibility and assist me with the maintenance of the minor. He has over the years willfully withdrawn support towards the maintenance of the minor thus denying her what is rightfully hers and forcing me to take full responsibility for the minor,” The plaintiff is requesting that Sonko be ordered to pay school fees for the minor totaling Ksh.86,000, as well as Ksh.30,450 to cover school-related expenses and upkeep for the minor, pending the outcome of the suit. The plaintiff, who claims the minor is in Form 2, also wants Sonko compelled to pay the outstanding school fee balance of Ksh.37,000 so that the child can return to school. She claims to have met Sonko in 1999 and to have been romantically involved with him on and off. According to her affidavit, their daughter was born in 2007. According to the court papers, Sonko gave her Ksh.100,000 in 2018 to offset the Minor's fees but has remained uncommittal on the child's upkeep, causing her opprobrium. “The unequal treatment has affected the minor psychologically as she does not understand why her father is abrasive towards her. Besides, the minor has been bullied and ridiculed in school because of her surname thus causing her emotional trauma and has indicated she wants to be transferred from the school,” she adds.
