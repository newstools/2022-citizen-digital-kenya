Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party leader
Raila Odinga has announced that the Azimio la Umoja movement, which he is
spearheading ahead of the August polls, will officially be registered as a
political outfit next week. This follows the Wednesday signing into law
of the recently enacted Political Parties (Amendment) Bill of 2021 by President
Uhuru Kenyatta. Odinga said upon registration of Azimio La
Umoja, it will be all systems go to bring Kenyans together as he drums up
support for his presidential bid. "I'm happy that you people have joined
ODM which is a member of the new group we are forming; Azimio la Umoja... Azimio
la Umoja is going to be registered next week if not tomorrow... and we will
start moving. Mtaona mambo mengi ikifanyika," he said. The former prime minister was speaking on
Thursday at Chungwa House as he welcomed a section of defectors from the
Musalia Mudavadi-led Amani National Congress (ANC) party into ODM. At the same time, he laughed off the new
political dalliance bringing together Deputy President  William Ruto, Mudavadi
and Ford-Kenya party leader Moses Wetangula. He termed the new formation as a mere outfit
of "birds of the same feather" with no better motive to serve
Kenyans. "Wale wengine wanabwekabweka.... nani
amekufunga wewe? Kama unataka kwenda, kwenda kabisa...kwenda kabisan wazungu
wanasema 'birds of the same feather flock together', kuna kitu ambayo inaunganisha
hawa watu pamoja... si nyinyi mnajua?" posed Odinga. “Tutatembea pamoja na wale wako na sera kama
sisi... Karibuni tena. Kenya hii itachemka. Acheni kutishwa na hawa watu. Hii
ni taka taka."  The ODM boss told the DP Ruto-led team to
brace themselves for a tough political race starting next week.
