  Kalonzo who was the vice president during Kibaki’s second term from 2007 to 2013 was not given a platform to address the congregants on the two occasions.  Speaking during the burial of Mzee Michael Mutuku Nduto, father to Masinga Constituency Wiper candidate David Mutuku in Masinga on Tuesday, Kalonzo told off leaders politicizing the issue.  “Let Mzee Mwai Kibaki rest in peace, don’t make him a subject of debate whether or not I was able to sing at his funeral,” Kalonzo said.  He added: We are bigger than that, we are more intelligent than that, we have greater tolerance than that; and quite frankly, if you want to continue that discussion about Kibaki’s burial, don’t mention my name.”  The Wiper leader underscored that he had no resentment regarding the instance and should not be used as a scapegoat for leaders in the rival camp.  “I had a singular privilege of working with Mzee Kibaki for five years. And it was enough for me to have been there at Nyayo Stadium and Othaya,” he remarked.  This comes as Deputy President William Ruto's allies continue to constantly ask the Wiper leader to ditch the Raila Odinga-led Azimio la Umoja One Kenya party and save himself further humiliation.  “Although I am on the other side, I am pained when I see how Odinga and President Kenyatta undermined Musyoka during the funeral of former President Mwai Kibaki. As if that is not enough, Odinga is planning to take Musyoka through a panel that includes his ally, Kitui Senator Enoch Wambua, to determine if he is suitable to be his running mate,” Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen said on Monday.  “This is the biggest indication that Musyoka will be cast aside. Those of us who are in Kenya Kwanza still believe that Musyoka has a contribution to make in leadership. Come to our side and let us work together.”
