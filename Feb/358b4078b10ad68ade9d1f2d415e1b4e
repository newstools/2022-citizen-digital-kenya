 This is after Sabina's lawyers led by Senator James Orengo, Otiende Amollo and Martin Oloo raised preliminary objections against Sabina's charge. The three opined that the electoral code of conduct does not apply to politicians until the official campaign period. "It is the jurisdiction that is at the armpit of the court. Inviting Sabina is one that constitutes overarching by this Commission," said Senior Counsel  Otiende Amollo. Otiende insisted that the country has not entered the official campaign period therefore IEBC was overreaching in the mandate by inviting Sabina. On his side, Orengo warned the commission that they are putting themselves on trial by purporting to put Sabina on trial. "This is something that was determined by the Supreme court, the ruling was clear, and so you are putting yourself on trial once again, not by our invitation, but by your own invitation," Orengo said. Sabina was summoned to appear before the IEBC's Electoral Code of Conduct Enforcement Committee led by Chairman Wafula Chebukati after she made utterances in Vihiga county, claiming that the 2017 election results were tampered with and the same could happen in August this year.
