 Gicheru surrendered to the ICC on the second of November in 2020, five years after a warrant of arrest was issued against him. Gicheru is accused of corruptly influencing witnesses in the case against deputy President William Ruto which was thrown out in 2016 due to insufficient evidence. The lawyer who has been out on conditional bail is expected to attend the opening of his trial although the defence team is not expected to present any statements at this stage. The ICC believes lawyer Gicheru committed offenses against the administration of justice in order to undermine the Prosecution’s case against Deputy President William Ruto and radio presenter Joshua arap Sang. “Specifically, with relation to eight witnesses, Mr Gicheru and other members of the common plan allegedly identified, located, and contacted the witnesses, offered and/or paid them financial or other benefits, and/or threatened or intimidated them, in order to induce them to withdraw as Prosecution witnesses, refuse to or cease cooperating with the Prosecution and/or the Court, and/or to recant the evidence which they had provided to the Prosecution,” the court said in a July 2021 statement. “The decision on the confirmation of the charges only serves to determine whether the Prosecutor’s case should proceed to trial. It does not establish the guilt of the accused person, who is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt by a trial chamber of the Court.” The ICC issued an arrest warrant against lawyer Gicheru and Philip Kipkoech Bett on March 10, 2015 for what it termed as “offenses against the administration of justice consisting of corruptly influencing witnesses.” Gicheru surrendered himself to authorities in the Netherlands on November 2, 2020, over five years after the arrest warrant was issued. He was taken into ICC custody on November 3, 2020 before making his first appearance before the court on November 6, 2020.
