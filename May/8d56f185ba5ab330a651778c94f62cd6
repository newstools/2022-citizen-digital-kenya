Police have launched a manhunt for eight robbery-with-violence suspects who escaped
from Thika Police Station in Kiambu on Wednesday night. The eight were among 9 remandees who were locked up in a cell
when they duped the cell guard on duty before storming out of the premises at
around 10pm. The suspects identified as Livingstone Njau, Francis Matheri,
Allan Mugai, Charles Mitaru, John Murege, Eric Ngigi, Arthur Kayemba and Bunton
Mbugua were held in the facility pending court appearance. The Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI), in a
statement on Thursday, said that one of the remandees pretended to have a bowel
infection and needed an urgent visit to the lavatory. The rest pleaded with the guard to accompany their
"unwell colleague" before he soiled the entire cell. Oblivious of the scheme hatched by the remandees, the officer
opened the door and immediately the suspects mobbed him and took away the
keys to the main door. "No sooner had he opened the door than the nine escapees
attacked him with blows and kicks, before forcibly taking away keys to the main
door leading to the cells," wrote the DCI. The ninth prisoner, Joseph Nyaguthii, was rearrested by
traffic standby personnel, approximately 500 metres from the station as the
rest bolted for freedom. Meanwhile, the guard is in custody at the same police
station, assisting detectives with investigations into the escape suspected to
be an inside job.
