Makueni County governor Kivutha Kibwana is recovering after undergoing a minor surgery on Saturday January 15. Governor Kibwana, according to a statement on his Twitter account, underwent the surgery at Makueni Referral Hospital in Wote. He has however not disclosed the nature of his condition to the public. "Undergoing a minor surgical procedure under Jacob Kengere Ombogo and Dr Patrick Musyoki at Makueni County Referral Hospital,Wote. "Thank you our healthcare workers for the dedicated health services offered to our residents," read the statement. Kenyans on social media have lauded the Makueni County boss for preaching water and drinking it, and for restoring trust in public hospitals. "Wishing you quick recovery Governor. May you enjoy good health all the days of your life. Thank you for showing us confidence in our health workers and systems when it is easy to fly out of the country and receive treatment," commented veteran gospel signer Reuben Kigame. "If our healthcare systems are managed well, anyone can get treatment in public facilities. The only problem is that they're mismanaged and the rich end up flying out of the country to seek for best treatment. Good job governor," wrote Ephy Ochi on twitter. "Such confidence n improving our health care facilities is all we need....You empowered them...equipped the hospitals n hence you know you can as well seek treatment there....Sir...Your simplicity n dedication to your people is what other leaders should emulate," said Wifred Njihia. The county boss is serving his second and last term in office, set to lapse in August after the general elections. Owing to his record as Makueni county boss, he has since presented himself for the country's top job. He has called on Kenyans to join and support his bid, through the Muungano party which he plans to use in clinching the seat.
