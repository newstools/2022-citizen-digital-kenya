Italian
Prime Minister Mario Draghi said
he would resign later Thursday after the 5-Star movement, the largest party in
the coalition government, withdrew its support in a parliamentary confidence
vote. Despite
the 5-Star boycott, Draghi's measures passed by 172 to 39. However, it left the
government at real risk of collapse and could lead to an early election. "I
want to announce that this evening I will present my resignation to the
President of the Republic," Draghi said in a statement. "Today's
votes in Parliament are very significant from a political point of view. The
majority of national unity that has supported this government since its
creation is no longer there," he added. Draghi
was appointed
Prime Minister if Italy in 2021 to help the country recover
from the Covid-19 crisis. He was seen as a safe pair of hands that would be
able to responsibly use the European Union's Covid recovery funds. Draghi had
previously served as President of the European Central Bank from 2011 to 2019.
Upon taking the job he appointed a cabinet comprising of people from a wide
range of Italy's political parties.  Draghi
had previously said that he would not lead a government that did not include
5-Star, the largest party in Italy's party. The populist 5-Star movement
objected to Draghi's cost-of-living package on the grounds it didn't go far
enough, though it had been threatening to withdraw its support for a long time.
