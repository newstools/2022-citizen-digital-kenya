 The KCSE candidate from Radat Secondary School is said to have raised suspicions among the police officers stationed at the examination center after he was seen jumping over the school wall while dressed in civilian clothes. According to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI), the student was discovered with two other unknown people who then fled after being ambushed, leaving behind a mobile phone containing copies of examination papers. "Detectives who were within the school’s vicinity became suspicious and followed suit over the fence...He and two other unknown persons who were conversing in low tones scampered to different directions when the detective announced his arrival, leaving behind a mobile phone that contained a replica of the Geography and Physics papers administered on Tuesday and the Agriculture paper that the candidates sat yesterday," said DCI Meanwhile, four more suspects were arraigned at the Milimani Law Courts in Nairobi, who were part of a larger syndicate known as 'Bailing out' and the 'Kalee' group arrested two weeks ago. The four had orchestrated examination fraud in social media groups with tens of thousands of followers who were buying examination papers and answers for the ongoing KCSE exam, according to detectives. The four were released on a Ksh.300,000 cash bail or a Ksh.500,000 bond after pleading not guilty. Other suspects were rounded up in Mbita, Garbatula, and Turkana, where over 60 mobile phones were confiscated, as part of a countrywide operation led by DCI detectives to ensure that the national examination's credibility is upheld.  Cybercrime detectives are currently examining the phones in order to recover additional incriminating materials in order to build a strong case against the suspects.
