The Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party
leader Raila Odinga’s wife Ida Odinga has urged Kenyans to look after her
husband now that he has set his eyes on the presidency seat at the August
polls. Speaking at Kasarani Stadium on Saturday
during ODM’s National Delegates Conference (NDC), Mama Ida recounted how in
December 2021 she officially gave her blessings to Raila to move with purpose
and serve the people of Kenya diligently in the event that he emerges
victorious at the polls. “On December 10, 2021, when we were in the
same grounds I handed him over to Kenya. What I am asking Kenyans to do is take
care of him,” she said. “That is all I am asking and for me at home,
I will not give him peace. I will make sure he does the right thing for the
people of Kenya in future.” Mama Ida similarly urged Kenyans not to
disregard the significance of integrating peace and stability in their
mentality ahead of the August polls. According to Mama Ida, history has time and
again proven that elections fuelled by violence do not attain the preferred
democratic outcome, citing that free and fair elections can only be realised
when peace is observed. “We saw it and chances are if we don’t work
towards the peace of this country, we will not make it. We must leave this
place; we must leave this country a united one for the sake of our children,” she
said. She likewise called on the country’s women to
advocate for peace during the electioneering period since it provides hope for
a better future.  “Ladies must be on the frontline to make sure
that we get what we want out of this. We are going to go out as the women of
Kenya, to campaign and to tell the people of Kenya why it is important to have
a peaceful leader,” she said.
