The Kenya Airways (KQ) treated tennis
champion Angela Okutoyi to a surprise after her Wimbledon win. 18-year-old Okutoyi, who made history by becoming the first Kenyan
girl to win an Australian Open juniors match was flown back to Kenya on Monday
aboard KQ’s business class. This was after
Tennis Kenya made a request to the airline to upgrade her to business class. On the flight, the
attendant called for the attention of other passengers to congratulate Okutoyi for
making Kenya proud. After landing,
cakes and champagne bottles were set on the plane to throw a mini-party for the
Wimbledon champion. “Karibu
nyumbani @Okutoyiangella2 .Ladies
and gentleman, the Kenyan queen of tennis is here!” KQ wrote in a tweet. The
tennis queen was met with a warm welcome from top officials from the Ministry
of Sports including Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed. Okutoyi’s return follows a spectacular performance at Wimbledon alongside Dutch partner Rose Marie
Nijkamp. They duo bet Canadian Kayla Cross and Victoria Mboko by two
sets to one to clinch the win at the Australian open.
