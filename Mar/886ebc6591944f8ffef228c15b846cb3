 Nonetheless, the most common challenge in the world of cashless payment is sending money to unintended or wrong recipients. We all know how painful and stressful this can be. So, if you happen to send money to the wrong person or to the unintended till/paybill number, take action immediately by following either of these options: Request for an M-PESA reversal via SMS to 456 If you send money to the wrong person; 1. Copy the whole M-Pesa message you received after sending money to the wrong person and send it to 456. 2. You will receive a response from “Reversal" that the request for a reversal has been started, and that an update will be shared within 2  hours. Call customer care on 100 If you have paid money to the wrong till/pay bill number; 1. Dial 100 and select the option to speak to a Safaricom customer care agent who will then ask a few questions to verify your identity and the number you mistakenly sent money to. 2. The agent will then initiate the reversal transaction and you will receive your money back within 72.
