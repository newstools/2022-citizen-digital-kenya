 Jacobeth has been in remand at the Kakamega Prison since January 2021 after being arrested and charged with the murder of her mother in the same month in Shishembe,  Kakamega South. The 31-year-old says her decision to re-sit the KCPE exam, having done in 2007 and emerged with 305 marks, was a step towards reconnecting with her family which she hasn’t seen since being locked up. “I have been in Kakamega Prison remand since January last year. No close family member has visited me since then,” Jacobeth said in an interview with The Standard, “It hurt my mental health and I found solace in education.” Her performance was no mean feat, according to the prison’s officials, who said that the majority of inmate candidates score an average of 250 marks. “The fact that one is behind bars does not mean your brain is behind bars. All one needs to do is to stay focused and go for the available opportunities to leave a mark on those around you,” Jacobeth previously told Nation. “Being behind bars is not the end of the world. All that one needs is to be disciplined and remain focused in life. I decided to spend part of my time studying. I made a decision to prepare for the KCPE exam and I’m happy to have scored good marks.” A former Form Three dropout at Eregi Girls’ Secondary School, Jacobeth plans to continue  with secondary education as her case progresses. She said she is determined to utilize every chance she has, including online learning channels in prison, to soar greater heights in education.
