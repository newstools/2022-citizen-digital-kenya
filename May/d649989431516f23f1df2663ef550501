 The deadline was to lapse on Monday, May 9. However, in a statement released on Monday, the electoral commission noted that some parties were yet to meet the requirement hence the decision to extend the timeline to Thursday, May 12 at 5pm. "Today, the Commission has reviewed the list of Political Parties that have resubmitted their respective nomination lists and found that there is a notable improvement in compliance. However, there are some Political Parties that are yet to resubmit their nomination lists due to time constraints," reads the statement. The commission noted that the extension of the deadline is in keeping with the provisions of Article 83 (3) of the Constitution which stipulates that the conduct of elections should be facilitative. Non-compliant political parties, Chebukati insists, will not participate in the 2022 General Election for the said elective positions. Political Parties are advised that there shall be no further extension beyond the May 12th date.
