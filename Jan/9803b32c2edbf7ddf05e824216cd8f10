Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka now says
that the One Kenya Alliance (OKA) will introduce free secondary education if it
clinches the presidency at the August general elections. Speaking in Machakos on Saturday, Musyoka
stated that as a former Minister of Education during retired president Mwai
Kibaki’s stint, he understands the importance of making education free and
accessible for all Kenyans. “I once was Minister for Education, we
advised Mzee Kibaki to introduce free and compulsory primary education. As OKA
we will deliver free secondary education,” Musyoka said. The former Vice President continued on to say
that as a parent he understands the hardships that parental figures go through
when seeking funds to educate their children. Business disruption owing to COVID-19,
Musyoka stated, has not made their struggles any easier. “We understand the hardships that parents go
through and we want to lessen the load for them by introducing free secondary
education,” he added. Musyoka similarly took a swipe at political
aspirants giving enormous handouts to supporters during the elections season,
citing that most of the funds are obtained illegally and that Kenya should not
condone corruption.  He consequently asked Machakos residents to
back him in the race to State House.
