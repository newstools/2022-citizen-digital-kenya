 Speaking on Wednesday at St Mary's Mukunike Secondary School where he opened a new CBC classroom, Magoha warned those trying to deceive Kenyans on the importance of the curriculum, affirming that he will not allow the country to recede to its old systems. "Nobody is going to dare, no matter who he is to take our children back. You can bark out there but you cannot take a Grade 6 child back to Standard 1. The country is not going to allow you, who do you think you are. Leave politics out of this," Magoha stated. "You know if you think, and I know you can think, you will know why they want it to remain where they want it," added Magoha hitting out at politicians rallying against the curriculum. Magoha's comments come after the Amani National Congress (ANC) leader Musalia Mudavadi said they will scrap the CBC if they ascend into power in the August polls. The Musalia Mudavadi-led outfit said that under the administration of its leadership and his newfound partner Deputy President William Ruto, the curriculum will be scrapped, claiming it is as a major burden to parents. “The controversial Competence-Based-Curriculum (CBC) of education will be scrapped once the Ruto/Mudavadi government takes power in August,” wrote ANC party on Twitter. CS Magoha further said that the construction of classrooms for the CBC curriculum is well on schedule, adding that they aim to complete the construction by end of President Kenyatta's term. "We don't want all that transition to affect our children, so far we have completed over 700 classes that are 10%, those not started are less than 100, close to 2000 are at roofing level and the rest are at base level," he said. "Come January next year we hope we will have normalized and therefore the grade 6 will transit to the junior secondary school we intend to be done before the expiry of this government. We shall meet the deadline and beat it."
