Roots Party presidential candidate Prof.
George Wajackoyah now claims that he was offered Ksh.200 million to shelve
his ambitions, barely two months to the August polls. Wajackoyah, who made the allegations at a
Roysambu entertainment joint, said his political rivals had been threatened by
his rising popularity and sought to have him drop his bid. He dismissed the effort to bribe him saying
he was focused on ascending to the highest office in the land and would fight
until the last minute. “Recently they came to my place and said that
this Wajackoyah, why don’t we just pay him Ksh.200 million so that he can drop
his bid,” Wajackoyah said in a viral video. “I looked at them and told them that I am the
most learned man in Africa and I cannot be compromised. I have worked in higher
places like the United Kingdom and I can never betray the cause of young
people.” Despite not revealing the identity of the candidate
behind the alleged bribe, Wajackoyah argued that his stab at the State House
race had posed challenges to the bids of the two frontrunners, Azimio la Umoja
One Kenya flag bearer Raila Odinga and his Kenya Kwanza counterpart Deputy
President William Ruto. He told off the two leaders saying the time
had come for the people of Kenya to be liberated by anyone else rather than the
duo, whom he said have long dominated the politics of the country. “I want to tell Raila and Ruto that I am
Kenyan just like them. They should all go home with the president in August
since they are the ones responsible for the mess we are currently witnessing in
the country,” he remarked. “You hear them speak of giving wheelbarrows….others
say they will give Ksh.6,000 stipend, and we are telling them we will legalize
bhang.”  This comes after opinion poll results
released by TIFA last week ranked Wajackoyah third place in popularity within
Nairobi with 7 per cent behind Odinga (50) and DP Ruto (25).
