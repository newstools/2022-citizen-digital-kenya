 Sonko was impeached by the Nairobi County Assembly in December 2020 on allegations of gross misconduct and abuse of office. IEBC Commissioner Guliye says that the law dictates that no government official can be viable to vie for public office, if they have been found culpable to have been impeached sufficiently for any irregularities. "The law guides us that if you have been found to be culpable by a competent court of law to have been impeached sufficiently for any irregularities in performance of your duty then you can still be eligible to vie if you apply the correct legal mechanisms," said Guliye. "But if all those appeal mechanisms have been exhausted and therefore the final verdict is uncontested, then you shouldn't run." The entry of Sonko into politics has ruffled up feathers, with a petition already in court, seeking orders to bar the IEBC from clearing Sonko to contest in the upcoming elections. Petitioners argue that Sonko will not suffer any prejudice if barred from vying. Meanwhile, Sonko has stated that no one will stop him from running for the Mombasa top seat after receiving a Wiper party ticket to do so. Sonko will compete against ODM's Abdulswamad Shariff Nassir and former Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar, who is running on a UDA ticket, among others.
