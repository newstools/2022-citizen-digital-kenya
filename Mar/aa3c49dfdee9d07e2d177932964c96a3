NARC-Kenya Party leader Martha Karua says she was sidelined
by One Kenya Alliance (OKA) co-principals in their decision to sign a political
agreement with the Azimio La Umoja coalition that is led by Raila Odinga.  She however says that her OKA co-principals Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Gideon Moi (KANU) and Cyrus Jirongo (UDP) went ahead on their own to join Azimio La Umoja. “One Kenya Alliance (OKA) was our collaborators for the sole purpose of negotiating together. But our colleagues decided to sign an agreement on their own during the Azimio National Delegates Conference. This means the sole purpose of forming OKA failed on that day. But we are still friends,” she said in an interview with NTV on Monday. Karua declined to term the action by her OKA partners as betrayal, noting that everyone was at liberty to do as they wish. "As NARC-Kenya we cannot hold anyone back. I don't want to use the word betrayal because we all had the freedom to opt in or out of OKA. So it is their right," she said. Karua, who is seeking to be the next Governor for Kirinyaga County maintains that she is comfortable in NARC-Kenya
and is still open to negotiations with like-minded political players. “Martha Karua belongs to NARC-Kenya. She is not outside in
the rain… She is in a comfortable in a home called NARC-Kenya,” she said.  “There is no deadline for people getting coalitions we can
still walk together even with my former OKA team players.”
