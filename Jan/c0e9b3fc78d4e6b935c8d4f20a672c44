 Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana has bowed out of the presidential race in the upcoming August 9th General Election. Kibwana, who had expressed interest in the country’s top seat under the Muungano Party, declared that he will instead support Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) leader Raila Odinga’s bid. “I consulted with the people of Makueni and they gave me a go-ahead to support Azimio,” said Kibwana on Monday in Naivasha where Odinga held a meeting with governors allied to his Azimio La Umoja movement. Kibwana hailed Odinga as the ‘father of devolution, adding that his support for the former Prime Minister was motivated by his support for a decentralized system of governance. “Raila Odinga amepigania uhuru wa nchi  hii mpaka hata akawekwa kizuizini kwa miaka nane,” he said. “Ikiwa ni katiba ya 2010 alikuwa mbele alisaidiana na wenzake kuileta; katika ugatuzi, he is really the father of devolution, that is undisputed,” Kibwana added. The Makueni county boss, however, stated that his State House bid is not a closed chapter, stating that he will still give a shot at the presidency in future. “With my age, I will be back later with my presidential candidature under the Muungano Party,” the 67-year-old governor said. Monday’s convention saw over 30 governors from across the country endorse the ODM leader’s presidential candidature. Among those in attendance included Kitui governor Charity Ngilu and her counterparts Lee Kinyanjui (Nakuru), Hassan Joho (Mombasa), Wycliffe Oparanya (Kakamega), Martin Wambora (Embu) and Ann Kananu (Nairobi).
