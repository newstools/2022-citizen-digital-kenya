Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka now says that he should
not be subjected to applying
for the running mate position in the Azimio-One Kenya coalition. This after the coalition's council appointed a 7-member team
on Wednesday to advise presidential flag bearer Raila Odinga in choosing a suitable running
mate. The party’s Executive
Committee Secretary-General Junet Mohamed said the committee will be tasked
with identifying and submitting the name(s) of the potential candidate(s) to
deputize Odinga. Kalonzo, speaking in an
interview with KTN News, said that it is obvious he is the choice for the
running mate position and should not be asked to apply. "If we were to tell
each other the truth and everyone in our team knows the right thing to do. I do
not understand why anyone would ask me to apply for the position of running
mate. Did Raila apply to be the flag bearer?" he posed. He further stated that should Raila fail to pick
him as the running mate, he will
suffer a blow by losing on the
majority votes fromt he Ukambani region. "Truth be told, it
will be difficult to access the votes in Ukambani," he told KTN. He went on to give
assurance that he and Raila are politically potent to clinch the country's top
job adding that they had won in previous elections but they were rigged out. "Whenever Raila and
I run together, we can't lose any election. I keep on saying that in 2013 we
won and ended up to not win. Again in 2017 we won according to us but again we
didn't win. Now in 2022 I have said that I will support my brother Raila and
obviously we will win," he said. The Azimio La Umoja-One
Kenya Alliance tasked the
advisory committee set up to aid in settling the contention around the
presidential debate.  The team will consist
of; Bishop Peter Njenga, Archbishop Zacchaeus Okoth, Senator Enoch Wambua,
Michael Orwa, Dr. Noah Wekesa, Sheikh Mohamed Khalifa, and Beatrice Askul Moe.
