Former State House Chief of Staff Nzioka
Waita has hit out at critics and opponents of his Machakos gubernatorial ambitions
who claim he is not the right fit for the seat as he is unable to even speak in
his local dialect. According to Waita, who admits that he is not
fluent at the Kamba language but is learning by the day, it really does not
matter what language one speaks as long as they can get the job done. In any case, he argued, a section of his
opponents who have continuously written him off for his inability to fluently express
himself in Kamba cannot properly speak the English language themselves. Waita hence said this puts them on a level
playing field, further intimating that the contest should be about one’s
ability to represent the people of the region well and not on the basis of language. “Najua mimi nimetusiwa sana, wanasema ati ‘huyo
kijana hajui Kikamba.’ Kama mimi sijui Kikamba, ni kosa langu na ni shida ya
kulelewa na naomba radhi…lakini kila siku najifunza, naongea, and by the time
hii miaka tano inaisha sitawachomea picha….tutakuwa tukikoroga,” he said. “Waita doesn’t speak fluent Kikamba, wengine
hawaspeak fluent English so tuko sawa. Wengine wanapewa statement ya kusoma
wanashindwa…hao watu ndio mnataka kuwatuma they represent you?” The Machakos gubernatorial aspirant has,
meanwhile, announced the appointment of Caleb Mwamisi Muteti as his official
spokesperson.  The appointment, according to a statement to
newsrooms, is part of ongoing strategic efforts to ensure agility in the
execution of information dissemination functions at the Nzioka Waita Command
Centre.
