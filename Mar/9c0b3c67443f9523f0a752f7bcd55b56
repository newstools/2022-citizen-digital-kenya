NARC Kenya party leader Martha Karua now claims that
both the Azimio la Umoja movement and the Kenya Kwanza Alliance have rogue individuals, in their midst, who have in some capacity acted on
selfish interests while in government. According to Karua, these
individuals are responsible for augmenting corruption and misusing public funds in the country which has derailed economic development. “Mimi nawaambia hizo team zote mbili (Azimio, Kenya Kwanza) hakuna team
haina wezi, hakuna team haina wakora na hakuna team haina wachache wazuri,” she
said. “Natafta mwaka huu kwa Kenya mzima uongozi bora manake
tumeporwa mali yetu kwa national government na tumeporwa kwa kaunti karibu zote
za Kenya. Nawaomba kura zenu, tuweke kwa watu ambao ni waaminifu, watu wachape kazi na watu walio na utu ndani yao ndiyo watufanyie kazi,” she said. While insisting that she is yet to make a decision on
which coalition to join ahead of the August polls, Karua hinted that she will likely
be drawn to the political outfit with more service delivery-oriented members. “Ile mimi
nangojea ni kuangalia kwa makini nione ni team gani iko na watu wazuri, walio wengi,
wale naweza kujiunga nao ndiyo tukomboe Kenya mali yetu isiendelee kuporwa. Lazima
tuhitaji kupiga kura ya urais lakini kwa ile team tunaona iko na watu wanaweza
kuokoa Kenya,” said Karua.  She similarly drummed
up support for her governorship bid citing that she was the best candidate
to dethrone current governor Anne Waiguru. Other politicians who are
eyeing the seat include Kirinyaga Woman Rep Wangui Ngirici, former Governor
Joseph Ndathi and senator Charles Kibiru.
