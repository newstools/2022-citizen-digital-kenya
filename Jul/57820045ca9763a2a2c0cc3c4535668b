 The detectives, while responding to a tip-off, intercepted the thugs when they were staging a robbery mission. The officers challenged the suspects to surrender, but they instead opened fire, prompting the officers to fire back. It was during the shootout, DCI said, that three of the suspects were shot dead as three others escaped, albeit with gunshot wounds. "Without wasting time, the battle-hardened crime busters answered the provocation with finality, fatally wounding three of the thugs while a similar number escaped, their bodies riddled with gunshot injuries," DCI wrote. A berretta pistol loaded with four rounds of 9mm caliber, one toy pistol, one pocket phone, one HP laptop, one hammer, one Somali sword, and six assorted mobile phones were recovered from the scene. Police are presently in pursuit of the three runaways in a bid to bring them to book. Meanwhile, the bodies of the slain suspects are lying at the city mortuary pending identification.
