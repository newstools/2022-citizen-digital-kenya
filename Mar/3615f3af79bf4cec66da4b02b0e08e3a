 Confirming the arrest, Nairobi Traffic Commandant Joshua Omukata said the 16 suspects are detained at Parklands  Police Station as investigations into the incident continue. Mr. Omukata added that five motorcycles have also been impounded in connection with the incident that sparked public uproar. The traffic commandant clarified that the incident occurred on Friday, March 4 at around 5pm. According to the Nairobi traffic boss, the woman was driving from Limuru side when she knocked down a pedestrian prompting boda boda riders to accost her. In the video capturing the incident, the woman can be heard screaming as the men undress her as others order that she be removed from inside the car. She was however rescued by police officers who were around the scene of the incident. "Our officers rushed to save this motorist. They dragged her to the back seat and one of our officers drove her away," said Mr. Omukata. The Nairobi traffic commandant disclosed that the victim sustained fractures on the leg and is undergoing treatment at Kiambu Level 4 Hospital. He warned boda boda riders that stern action would be taken against them for such barbaric acts. "Boda boda riders need to behave. They need to be civilised in a way... Those who are adamant we are going to deal with them," said Mr. Omukata. The video caused uproar on social media on Monday afternoon, with scores calling for the regulation of the boda boda sector to tame such incidents. Interior Cabinet Secretary Dr. Fred Matiang'i has since condemned the incident terming it as disgusting. "I am shocked and disgusted by a viral video clip of a female motorist being molested by suspected boda boda riders along Wangari Maathai /Forest Road. We must protect our roads from such vile and reprehensible acts of aggression," he said in a statement released on his social media platforms.
