 Sonko had filed a case in Nairobi, seeking to have IEBC's decision barring from vying for the Mombasa gubernatorial seat on account of his impeachment, overturned. Justice Ngaah Jairus who presided over the matter directed that the matter be heard  at a High Court sitting in Mombasa which is of similar jurisdiction. Despite moving to court,  Sonko's gubernatorial bid remains in limbo after the court extended orders barring Sonko from presenting his nomination papers before the IEBC. His legal team opposed the extension, saying Tuesday, June 7 is the last day Sonko can present his papers before the IEBC for clearance. In his suit against the IEBC, Sonko said that the IEBC’s decision to block him from seeking the Mombasa gubernatorial seat is un-procedural, unlawful and inconsistent. “That there is an urgent need for the court to review its orders so that the ends of justice are sought,” the embattled politician says in court papers seen by Citizen Digital. He further argues that the Wafula Chebukati-led electoral body’s decision to bar him from contesting in the General Election was actuated by bias, ill motive, malice, and bad faith. He says that every action taken by IEBC disqualifies him from vying is unlawful. “The applicants' impeachment proceedings have not been concluded and are currently pending before the Supreme Court,” argues Sonko
