CNN
anchor and international correspondent Larry Madowo is back on social media after
missing in action for 4 months, and with good news no less. The
celebrated journalist took to his social media accounts to announce that he had
finally graduated from the New York-based Columbia University. Madowo,
who was pursuing a Masters in Business and Economics Journalism, expressed
excitement saying the in-person graduation ceremony came after a two-year
delay. “My
in-person graduation from @Columbia
was delayed by 2 years but it was still special. I came back to New York to
confirm that my master’s in Business & Economics Journalism was real. It is
& they haven’t changed their minds,” he wrote. He
had on Tuesday broken his silence while also celebrating another feat; his
first year anniversary at the CNN. Madowo,
in the LinkedIn post, urged his followers to suggest to him some of the stories
they would like him to cover in the African continent. “I'm one year old at CNN today. It's been an
extraordinary year reporting and anchoring from 4 continents and I couldn't be
more grateful,” he said. "But I'm an African first and I'd love to tell more of our stories.
Do you have any ideas? Please share in the comments or slide into my DMs.” Madowo, who started his broadcasting
career at KTN at the age of 20, has worked for NTV Kenya and CNBC Africa, where
he anchored the business channel’s daily market shows Open Exchange, Power
Lunch and Closing Bell in Johannesburg.  He also served as the BBC’s North America Correspondent in
Washington, D.C., covering major U.S. news stories including the Covid-19
outbreak, the 2020 presidential election and the protests following the death
of George Floyd and the trial of Derek Chauvin.
