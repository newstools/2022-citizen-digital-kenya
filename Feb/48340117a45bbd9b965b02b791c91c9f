 Speaking during the Kenya Day celebrations at the Expo 2020 Dubai, Mr. Kenyatta said that Kenya seeks to promote business-to-business partnerships and establish linkages between private and public sector institutions. “I wish to assure our audience today that Kenya is open and safe for business.  The legal framework for investment provides adequate investor protection in line with most international standards including safeguards for property rights,” he said. Kenya is one of 190 countries that are taking part in the Dubai Expo 2020 to showcase some of its greatest offerings to potential tourists and business investors. The head of state at the same time wooed the Gulf Cooperation Council saying the country is looking for more ways of working together. “Kenya is keen to build new trade relationships with the Gulf Cooperation Council States and participants of the Expo. We seek to harness the opportunities offered by this Expo to build new business partnerships, attract new investments, and bring tourists to Kenya to enjoy its world-renowned attractions,” said President Kenyatta. As part of his three-day tour of the UAE, the President met with Sheikh Mohamed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi. He also officiated a high-level Kenya-Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states business forum where he castigated government officials of being part of the problem preventing foreign investors from pitching camp in the country. After his speech, the President visited the Kenyan pavilion as he acknowledged greetings from hundreds of Kenyans, many who live and work in the UAE. “It is now my pleasure to welcome all of you to join us in celebrating Kenya’s richness and diversity, which will be showcased throughout the week,” he said. The Bomas Harambee Dancers also staged three performances as part of showing off the country’s rich heritage. They were also joined by President Kenyatta who could not resist shaking a leg.
