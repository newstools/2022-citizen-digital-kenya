One Kenya Alliance (OKA) co-principals Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetangula have dismissed claims that Deputy President William Ruto is courting them in the hopes of forming a coalition agreement ahead of the August polls.
Speaking in Nairobi on Wednesday, ANC leader Mudavadi insisted that he was constitutionally free to converse with any politician but clarified that neither DP Ruto nor his camp have approached him contrary to what is being purported by the media.
