Jubilee Party Vice-Chairman David Murathe has said there are thoughts of having the Azimio coalition party adopt Marijuana trade reforms that have recently been
publicised by Roots Partly leader Prof. George Wajackoyah. According
to Murathe, there is need to interrogate Wajackoyah’s Marijuana reforms
seriously, since the plant is benefiting other countries that are growing it for
medicinal purposes. “It is not
your normal weed. This is medicinal... You are not telling us
to grow weed in Galana or Mwea instead of food security, I like it in theory,”
he said. Murathe
added that they are now asking Azimio candidate Raila Odinga to consider the reform because it can be of great economic benefit to Kenya. “We are
asking him to consider in the next dispensation… for medicinal purposes because
the numbers Wajackoyah is giving are making sense,” said Murathe. With the
recent poll by TIFA placing the Roots Party leader third in the presidential
race, Murathe says the ‘Wajackoyah effect’ does not worry them. Instead, he says Wajackoyah’s rise is problematic to William Ruto’s camp since both their
manifestos appeal to the same generation – youngsters. “Who is he
hurting, he is definitely not hurting out corner. If Wajackoyah was to change
any dynamic… it is the deputy president’s corner that should be very worried,” he
said on AM Live. Murathe
noted that the Wajackoyah fuss is not one to be underlooked since it will
translate to a number of votes. Murathe
further dismissed the possibility of the Wajackoyah factor denying Azimio a win in
the first round of the General Election.  The Roots
Party leader has in recent days established a huge political fanbase for his
promises on the legalisation of bhang and snake farming in Kenya if he wins the elections.
