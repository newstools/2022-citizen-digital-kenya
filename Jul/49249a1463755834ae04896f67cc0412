Roots Party presidential candidate George
Wajackoyah has now promised to set free all prisoners convicted of
bhang-related charges if he ascends to power come August. Speaking
to residents of Mombasa as he drummed up support for his candidature on
Saturday, Wajackoyah - who previously also pledged to legalize marijuana - said
inmates who are facing such crimes would be freed and compensated by the State. “When I’m
sworn in, all those who have been arrested and jailed over bhang possession, I
will release all of them and go with them to State House,” he said. “Everyone
who would be freed on that day will be given Ksh.1 million and asked for
forgiveness for being arrested under punitive foreign laws imposed in our Parliament.” The
presidential hopeful who has been making headlines over his controversial
agenda further vowed to protect the interests of the police officers whom he
said will be respected in his governance. Referring
to the plight of the police department in terms of underpayment, Wajackoyah pledged
that his administration will cultivate a good relationship between civilians
and the police to ensure since nobody is over possessing bhang. “Kwa muda
mrefu imekuwa ni kitu kidogo askari…ile siku ya mwisho kupewa mshahara ilikuwa
ni siku ya Kibaki. Lazima tuwe na uhusiano mzuri na askari maanake hakuna
askari atashika mtu aliye na bangi wakati ambao nitakuwa nimeapishwa,” Wajackoyah
said. The Roots Party boss launched his 10-point
manifesto on Thursday as he pledged to fight corruption, legalize bhang,
introduce snake farming, and export dog meat among other contentious issues
which he says will help settle the country's debt and boost the economy.
