An
American tourist fell into the crater of Mount
Vesuvius in an attempt to retrieve his mobile phone at the
weekend, Italian police told CNN on Monday. The 23-year-old man from Baltimore was hiking an
unauthorized trail accompanied by three relatives on Saturday morning, the
carabinieri of the provincial command of Naples said. Two British tourists were
also spotted walking on the forbidden trail. Following the fall, the man reported only a few
bruises on his hands, arms and back. He was treated by an ambulance that arrived on
the scene, but he did not want to go to the hospital, police said. The path had clear signs warning of danger and
forbidden access, according to the force, which added that the prosecutor will
decide whether to proceed with a formal charge against them for invasion of
public territory. The
last eruption of Mount Vesuvius took place in 1944. It is still active, but is
in a state of repose, according to the Vesuvius National Park website. The
mountain's highest peak reaches 1,277 meters (4,190 feet), while the crater has
a diameter of 450 meters (1,476 feet) and is 300 meters (984 feet) deep, the
national park's website adds. Vesuvius
had been a dormant volcano for centuries before it erupted in 79 AD, burying
cities like Pompeii, Oplontis and Stabiae beneath ash.  Pompeii
was submerged under a 23-foot-deep layer of volcanic debris, which preserved
the ruins from the detrimental effects of weather and climate. It has since
become a popular tourist destination, as well as a rich site of study for
archaeologists.
