Roots Party presidential aspirant Prof. George
Wajackoyah now says his government will do away with the boda boda sector if he clinches the
country’s presidency at the August polls. Speaking during a campaign rally in Busia on
Saturday, Wajackoyah said the sector will be transformed by his legalization of
marijuana agenda, which he insists will offer Kenya economic freedom. The presidential hopeful argued that if he
ascends to power, his agenda of legalizing the hemp would create a lot of
capital, therefore boda boda riders will not need to hang around in their
current jobs which have limited potential for growth. "They (boda boda riders) will be at the
forefront cultivating and exporting bhang to generate millions of money for the
country," Wajackoyah said. He went on to allude that the sector in his
tenure will collapse since most Kenyans will generate enough income to lead decent
lives, hence it will be inconsequential. “We shall not need boda bodas on our roads
because there will be nobody to carry since most Kenyans will be millionaires
with money we will generate through bhang exportation,” he said.  Since starting his campaigns, the
controversial politician has been wooing voters countrywide with his agenda of
legalising bhang.
