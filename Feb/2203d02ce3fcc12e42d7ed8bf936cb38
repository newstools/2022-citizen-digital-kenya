Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) deputy party
leader Wycliffe Oparanya has refuted claims that he will join Deputy President
William Ruto's Kenya Kwanza brigade after he missed campaigns in Western Kenya
last week. Oparanya says he was away from the campaigns
because of other engagements on behalf of party leader Raila Odinga. The Kakamega Governor spoke on Tuesday at Khwisero Girls
Secondary School during the launch of a classroom construction drive, in an
event attended by other Azimio la Umoja-allied leaders. “Ninataka wale watu wa fitina waache fitina…wajue
sisi tumesimama kidete kwa Azimio…wale wavumi waendelee na uvumi yao…haitaenda
mahali kwa sababu sisi tumesimama imara kabisa,” said Oparanya.  Lugari MP Ayub Savula said: “Sisi kwa Azimio
tumesema tutalock Western. Na team leader wetu wa Western ni Wycliffe Ambetsa
Oparanya na Atwoli.”
