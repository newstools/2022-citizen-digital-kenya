 According to a police report, after receiving a tip about Stephen Limo's whereabouts, Corporal Benjamin Makau led a team of six to his home on Saturday and arrested him. Limo's wife, Grace Cherutich, however, raised an alarm, causing locals to swarm the scene with crude weapons and stones. The officers were then beaten up by the irate mob before they managed to escape. Corporal Makau, Kasudi Towet, James Kirungi, Emmanuel Wanyonyi, Chacha Marwa, and Bernard Kesis all suffered head injuries, while others suffered injuries to their hands, shoulders, and teeth. They were all rushed to Burnt Forest Sub County Hospital for treatment and were later released in good health. A manhunt has been launched for the suspect, who went into hiding shortly after.
