Azimio La Umoja One Kenya coalition flag-bearer Raila Odinga has cut
short his ongoing US trip, and will return to the country on Wednesday, in time
for Mzee Kibaki’s state burial. Odinga was meant to be in the US for a week, with several meetings with
the Kenyan diaspora as well as a smattering of US government officials. Following his arrival in the United States on Saturday, Raila held town
hall meetings with Kenyans living in Washington DC on Sunday as he kicked his
visit. He briefed the Kenyan diaspora on the state of the country, election
preparations, and his post-election plans for Kenya. The ODM leader is scheduled for meetings with corporate America on
Monday, according to a statement from his communications team. “In his engagements with corporate America on, Mr. Odinga will recognize
and appreciate US corporations that have set up in Kenya and encourage more
members of the group to take up the challenge to invest in Kenya,” a statement
from his communication team reads. “He will brief them on prevailing opportunities in Kenya and Africa,
call for collaboration in the war against corruption,” Thereafter, the 2022 presidential hopeful will hold engagements with
officials from the Executive arm of the US government on Tuesday. Odinga was also scheduled to meet with key US Senate and congressional
leaders on Capitol Hill, the legislative arm of the US government. His jam-packed itinerary was also to include meetings with thought
leaders from the Atlantic Council and the Centre for Global Development Think
Tanks. Among those accompanying the ODM leader are NARC Kenya leader Martha
Karua and Dr Sally Kosgei.  Other members of the delegation include Kakamega Governor Wycliffe
Oparanya, his Kisii counterpart James Ongwae, Homa Bay Senator Moses Kajwang,
and Kathiani MP Robert Mbui.
