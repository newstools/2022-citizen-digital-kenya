 Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja is expected to get the ticket for governor with Bishop Margaret Wanjiru likely to drop her bid and instead run for senator. Ruto has been calling for consensus among aspirants in the issuing of tickets to avoid a fallout. The DP had earlier on Saturday signed a coalition agreement with National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi's Democratic Party, hours to the midnight deadline for parties seeking to be in a coalition to declare so. During the signing, Ruto hit back at the National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC) over its list of hate speech words. This came after NCIC on Friday released a lexicon, among them words such as ‘hatupangwingwi’ and 'mtajua hamjui' which are commonly used by DP Ruto and his team, among dangerous words that it termed as having the potential to incite hate.
