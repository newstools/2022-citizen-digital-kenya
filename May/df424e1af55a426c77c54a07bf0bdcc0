Azimio la Umoja One Kenya presidential
aspirant Raila Odinga has termed as an act of betrayal the move by Kilifi
Governor Amason Kingi to decamp to the Kenya Kwanza alliance. Odinga, who took Azimio campaigns to Kingi's
rural village of Gongoni on Wednesday, assured his Kilifi base that they are a
step away from State House. “Leo nimerudi hapa Gongoni na moyo mzito
sana. Mwaka wa 2008, nilisimama hapa hapa nikaleta kijana ambaye alikuwa
amemaliza masomo yake, nikainua mkono yake hapa nikamfanya mbunge kasha baadaye
akawa gavana,” he said. Odinga added that he accorded Governor Kingi
all the support even during what he termed as Kingi's most trying moments. “Wakati kulikuwa na ile kesi ya nyumba
walilipa milioni 150 badala ya milioni 45, akakimbia kwangu ati niongeleshe
watu wa EACC,” said the former premier. Odinga accused Kingi of betrayal and called
on his supporters in Kilifi to remain firm. “Huyo kijana hana adabu, amenipiga teke ya
punda…asante ya punda ni mateke…sasa nyinyi mpigeni yeye teke,” he stated. Odinga allies from the Coast region also
laughed off what they termed as Kingi's inconsequential move. Narc Kenya party leader Martha Karua, who
accompanied Odinga to Tana River and Kilifi, affirmed that Azimio was intact
and will remain so after the naming of a running mate. “Mmetuona hapa na Joho na Sabina tumefanya
interview, na tumekubaliana Yule atachaguliwa bado sisi sote tutabaki Azimio,”
she said.  Odinga also saw the crowning of Governor Dhadho
Godhana as the Pokomo spokesman in a traditional ceremony held in Hadapia
village, Galole.
