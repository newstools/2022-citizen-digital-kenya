 A police officer in Nkubu, Imenti South, Meru County, has been arrested after shooting a civilian in the foot under mysterious circumstances. According to a police statement, police constable Roy Muchiri was found standing with 24-year-old Pharis Gitobu by another officer, Robert Kabetu, who was on a routine check of the area on Monday afternoon. Upon enquiry, Muchiri assured Kabetu that everything was fine and he proceeded with his patrol. Kabetu told the police that minutes later, he heard noise behind him where upon returning he found that Muchiri had shot Gitobu on his left ankle. Muchiri reportedly surrendered himself to the Nkubu police station thereafter and police recovered an AK-47 rifle with 29 rounds of ammunition from him. Gitobu is meanwhile currently admitted at the Consolata Mission Hospital. Police have launched investigations into the incident as the constable remains in custody.
