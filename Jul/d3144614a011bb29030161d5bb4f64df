The board of a Turkish manufacturing
conglomerate has named Kenyan businessman Mwaniki Munuhe as Vice President in
charge of its Africa Operations. This was announced during the ground breaking
ceremony of a USD 760 million (Ksh.91 billion) investment project presided over
by President Uhuru Kenyatta at the Naivasha Special Economic Zone on Tuesday. Mr. Munuhe, 36, now becomes the first African
to ever be appointed to the role at Turkish Ceramic, Granite and Tiles SEZ
throughout the corporation’s history. Turkish Industry Holdings Vice President
Abdulhakim Alici, who made the announcement before President Kenyatta, said Mr.
Munuhe “is a testament that Kenya has some of the finest entrepreneurial skills
in the world.” “We met him a while back and in a short time
he was able to contribute great value to our corporate global planning,” stated
Mr. Alici. “He has been an important part of our journey
to Kenya and will henceforth lead the work that is ahead of us in Africa. We
have full confidence that Mr. Munuhe is more than equal to the task that we are
bestowing on him today.” He added that the project will consist of six
manufacturing companies, namely; Ceramics and
granite, Sanitary hardware, Tissue paper, MDF, Aluminum, and Steel. Mr Alici further said the investment will directly
employ 2,860 people with an additional 45,000 people benefiting indirectly;
further that it will pump into Kenya’s economy USD 550 million (Ksh.65 billion)
annually. “It was not easy to marshal an investment of
this magnitude, especially as we were unfamiliar with Kenya investment
infrastructure,” he said.  “But after a long and rigorous appraisal we
became convinced that Kenya is the most attractive investment destination —
politically, economically, and geographically — for large scale investments. We
became convinced that Kenya offers us the greatest potential.”
