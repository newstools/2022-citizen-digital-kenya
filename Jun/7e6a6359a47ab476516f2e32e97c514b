Attackers raided the Karma industrial gold
mine in northern Burkina Faso in the early hours of Thursday morning, killing
one soldier and one mine employee, the company said. The mine has suspended operations to focus on
securing the site, Nere Mining Group, the Burkina Faso-based consortium that
owns it, added. Three or four soldiers were also wounded in
the assault, which took place at around 4:30 a.m. (0430 GMT), an official who
answered the phone at Nere Mining told Reuters. The call was cut off before he
could give his name. The company said the assailants were not
identified, and that the attack was eventually repelled by mine security
workers and soldiers. It is still evaluating the impact, it said. Islamist militants linked to al Qaeda and
Islamic State have been waging an insurgency in northern Burkina Faso for
nearly a decade and routinely carry out attacks. Several of those have targeted convoys on
their way to and from the region's gold mines. An ambush on buses carrying
employees of Canadian firm Semafo in 2019 was the deadliest, killing 39 people. Attacks on the mines themselves, however,
have been much rarer. A diplomatic source said three people had
been killed at the mine and 10 others injured, eight of them seriously. A
Burkinabe security source said about 200 unknown attackers had arrived just
before dawn. Video shared by one of the sources showed
several burnt-out vehicles inside the mine complex. Reuters could not confirm
the authenticity of the video. The president of Burkina Faso's mines chamber
said in April that extra measures would be taken to protect gold projects in
the north after Russia's Nordgold shut down its mine there, citing
deteriorating security. Nere Mining purchased Endeavour Mining's 90%
stake in the Karma mine in March for $25 million (about Ksh 2.9 billion). It
produced about 88,000 ounces of gold in 2021.
