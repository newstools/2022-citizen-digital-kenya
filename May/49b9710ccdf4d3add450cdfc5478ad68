Police in Kiambu County have arrested one more suspect in connection with the
death of a Kenya Institute of Mass Communication (KIMC) student, Purity Wangeci. Isaac Kariuki Kibui, 22, was arrested on Monday morning at
Thindigua Delish Nail bar in Kiambu county as detectives were pursuing more
suspects. The Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) said Kibui
was then escorted to his house where a blood-stained jacket worn by the main
murder suspect was found. "After the arrest,
Kariuki was escorted to his house where a comprehensive search was conducted
leading to the discovery of a blood-stained jacket, worn by the suspect on the
night of the murder," DCI wrote. "The jacket, shall
be subjected to forensic analysis by experts based at the Biology unit of the
DCI National Forensic Laboratory." The detectives will be seeking to establish
whether the blood stains match with samples collected from the deceased. Puirty Wangeci, 19, is
said to have left college on Friday to visit her boyfriend in Kirigiti, Kiambu
County. Her body was then found
dumped by the roadside near Mburiria estate early Saturday morning, with stab
wounds and strangulation marks. Meanwhile, three other suspects who have since
been arrested and arraigned will remain in police custody for another 14 days after a  Kiambu
magistrate ordered them to undergo mental check-ups to ascertain if they are fit
for trial.  The trio, 24-year-old
John Wanyoike Kibungi, alias VDJ Flex, Kanaiya Kamau and Brendan Muchiri, were arrested on Sunday,
