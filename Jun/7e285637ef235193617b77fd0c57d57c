 Duale says that he was approached by President Kenyatta while acting as the National Assembly Majority Leader, and asked to choose on whose side he would prefer after DP Ruto and Uhuru broke ties. Duale said he opted to affiliate with DP Ruto's , claiming that he could not join the other team that "humiliated the DP and his office." "The president told me that I have a split loyalty and that I had to decide between me and the Deputy President. And I asked him if the marriage is no longer tenable and he said 'yes'," Duale to NTV on Saturday. "So I said I cannot coalesce around a group that wants to humiliate, demean and despise both the character and the stature of the office of the Deputy President. I told him 'Mr President I am ready to go, let me relinquish myself as the leader of majority and look for somebody else'." The legislator further defended his decision to support the DP, arguing that they had close ties and has never crossed him in their entire political engagements. "William Ruto, to the best of my knowledge until now, in the whole of his political life, he has done good deeds to me. There is no single bad deed that William Ruto has done to me or to my family and my constituency," said Duale. Duale, now in the Ruto-led Kenya Kwanza camp, has been claiming that the only leader who can be likened to President Kibaki's exemplary leadership, and who the country deserves as Head of State is Deputy President William Ruto.
