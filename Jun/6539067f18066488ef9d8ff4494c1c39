 The four were caught on Saturday night in Mauche Ward, Nakuru County, according to a police report seen by Citizen.Digital The suspects are said to have shared a photo on social media showing off their weapons, a situation that prompted investigations. "The arrests followed police investigations after a photo of the suspects wielding crude weapons was shared on a popular social media platform on May 25, 2022," the report explains. "They proudly paraded their crude weapons, without regard to security concerns in their neighborhoods." According to the report, 25 arrows were recovered during the arrests, and will be used in court as exhibits. Meanwhile the four are being processed for arraignment by the Njoro Sub-County Criminal Investigations Office. The police further urged members of the public to responsibly use social media platforms and "desist from acts that would trigger violence and other criminal activities in their neighborhoods," as the country heads towards the August 9 polls.
