Nakuru County Governor Lee Kinyanjui will now be defending
his seat on a Jubilee party ticket come August General Elections. The county governor defected from Ubuntu People’s Forum
(UPF) party to the President Uhuru Kenyatta-led party on Friday. Taking to social media on Friday, he went forth to defend the move saying it was informed by
the top leadership of the coalition. “To consolidate Azimio Coalition support base and lead the
campaign team in the region, a decision has arrived that I defend my
Governor seat on Jubilee Party ticket. I, therefore, wish to state that I will
defend my seat as Nakuru Governor on Jubilee ticket,” he wrote on Twitter. “This decision has been made in full consultation with top
leadership and members of Ubuntu Peoples Forum party.” The county boss similarly noted that the UPF party would field and support its
candidates in respective elective positions in line with its mandate. He however noted that the Azimio faction was focused on holding
discussions to settle on the same candidates for each seat in all elective
positions soon after the party primaries. “We are deeply aware of attempts by the opponents to sponsor
candidates in various parties with a view to split our support base,” Kinyanjui
said.  “We shall be unveiling the candidates under Azimio after the
nominations and will strive to have only one candidate for each seat from MP to
Governor. We are aware that this decision is inconvenient for some of our supporters
and opponents. Kindly accept our sincere apology,” he added.
