Azimio la Umoja One Kenya flagbearer Raila
Odinga on Tuesday campaigned in Kisumu County where he pledged to establish a
factory in each of the 47 counties to boost agriculture and commerce if elected
President. Speaking at Ahero, Odinga said he will
increase County Revenue Allocation from 15 to 35 per cent if he ascends to the
top office in the land. Barely 24 hours after naming Martha Karua as
his presidential running mate in Azimio, Odinga took his campaign to the Nyanza
region. The ODM party leader pledged to revive the
Ahero Rice irrigation scheme project saying: “We want people to invest in smart agriculture. There will be a ready market
so that farmers benefit from agricultural produce.” Odinga also announced that already plans to
set up a special economic zone in Miwani are underway. “We
want to set up a special economic zone in Miwani…we have already secured an
investor who is willing to develop the area,” he stated. Odinga pledged that an Azimio la Umoja
administration will ensure a new factory is set up in each of the 47 counties
in the country. “We
want to set up factories in each county…in line with Vision 2030, we will
establish 3 new export processing zones, one in Mombasa, Lamu and Kisumu...so
that our young people get employed,” he stated.  The Azimio leader also praised his running
mate Martha Karua as a leader of integrity, adding that jointly they will
ensure inclusivity through Azimio la Umoja initiatives.
