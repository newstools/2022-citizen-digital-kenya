 The 31 were shortlisted by the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) from a pool of 68 candidates who had applied for the position after a March 14 advertisement. Those shortlisted alongside Hassan are High Court Judges Hedwig Ong’udi, Justice John Mativo, Senior Counsel Patricia Nyaundi, National Gender and Equality Commission Chairperson Winfred Lichuma, and Justice Nduma Nderi, among others. Some 266 people had at the same time applied for the High Court judge positions, out of which the commission has shortlisted 104. Hassan’s deputy at the electoral body, Lilian Mahiri-Zaja, is among  the High Court judge shortlist, which also includes Emily Ominde, a Magistrate Representative in JSC, as well as  Anti-Corruption Court Chief Magistrate Douglas Ogoti. “Members of the public are invited to avail in writing any information of interest in respect to any of the shortlisted candidates,” JSC Secretary Anne Amadi said on Wednesday. Hassan and Zaja served the Commission between 2011 – 2016 before being removed amid mounting pressure from the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (CORD). The Raila Odinga-led outfit accused IEBC of bias in the 2013 General Election and messing up its attempt at constitutional reform through a popular initiative dubbed Okoa Kenya. JSC will hold interviews for the position of the Judge of the Court of Appeal from June 20 through July 6. Those seeking the position of Judge of the High Court, on the other hand, will be interviewed from July 7 to August 8. The commission seeks to recruit 6 more Judges of the Court of Appeal and 20 judges of the High Court to bolster its efforts in clearing the backlog of cases the Judiciary has.
