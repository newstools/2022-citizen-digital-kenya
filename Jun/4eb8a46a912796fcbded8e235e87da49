Education Cabinet
Secretary Prof. George Magoha has proposed the verification of all degrees in
the country to weed out fake academic papers. Speaking on
Wednesday in Rongo, Migori County, Prof. Magoha said if he were to have the
power as Education CS, he would
order the verification of all degrees. He was speaking
when he visited Koderobara Secondary School to assess the preparation ahead of
the launch of Competency-Based Curriculum in junior secondary school. The CS said the
issue of fake degrees should be dealt with professionally, adding that the
Commission for University Education should be given time to handle the issues
because it lies within their mandate. “It is very
unfortunate that the issues of fake degrees are now being politicised instead
of being handled professionally,” said the CS. Prof. Magoha added
that the verification of degrees is a very easy task which can be handled by
the relevant bodies. His remarks come
amid ongoing debate about the authenticity of degrees held by politicians
seeking elective seats in the August General Election. In the meantime,
Prof. Magoha has indicated that the government is prepared to roll out CBC
education in junior secondary schools. He said the
government is also handling the issues raised by the private schools on issues
of CBC education According to the
CS, the ministry has registered 1,280,000 learners for the Grade Six examination scheduled for later this
year.
