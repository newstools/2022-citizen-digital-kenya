 Sabina Chege is required to appear before the commission's Electoral Code of Conduct Enforcement Committee on Tuesday, February 15. "WHEREAS THE COMMISSION is seized of a report and material against yourself in regard to violation of clause 6(0) and 6(1) of the Electoral Code of Conduct, you are hereby required to attend the Offices of the Commission at Anniversary Towers 6th floor on the 15th day of February 2022 at 9 .00 o'clock," reads the summon letter. Speaking in Vihiga County on Thursday during a campaign tour of Azimio La Umoja-allied leaders, Sabina Chege said there was some truth in claims that votes were stolen in the last election and the same could be replicated in this year's polls. "Mnajua kule Central nimeskia wengine wakisema tuliwaibia. Kuna ka ukweli kidogo. Lakini kama tulijua kuiba... si hata hii tutafanya ninii... Kwani wanafikiria wao ndio wajanja? she posed. Her remarks have triggered a political fireball with leaders allied to Deputy President William Ruto's UDA party coming out guns blazing to castigate the Murang'a Woman Rep. On Friday, during UDA's campaign rally in Kuresoi, Nakuru County, various leaders who accompanied the deputy president accused their rivals in the Azimio la Umoja movement of plotting to rig the upcoming August elections. Deputy President has since dismissed the Woman Rep's remarks insisting that they won the last elections fairly.
