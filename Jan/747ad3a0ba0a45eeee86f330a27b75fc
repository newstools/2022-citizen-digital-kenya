The family of security analyst Mwenda Mbijiwe who went missing nearly seven months ago are reminding the authorities that they are still waiting for answers to the whereabouts of their kin who went missing in June 2021. In a bid to pile pressure on authorities, his brother Nicholas Bundi has now chosen to carry out a symbolic walk from Meru County to the DCI headquarters in Nairobi to raise awareness about the families plight as they await news on their missing loved one. "Nobody has ever given us a file to read... As a family we need to know the truth. I am walking to the DCI headquarters and I will not leave there without answers," said Mbudi. He expects to meet the DCI boss George Kinoti in a bid to understand how far they are with the investigations. Nicholas embarked on this journey on Monday, seeking to find answers on the whereabouts of his brother. Given the fact that her son was frequently on TV stations and had even tried his hand in politics, Mwenda's mother says something should have been done by now. "We have really been through a lot of suffering. There is no office in this country we have not set foot in. It is really painful. We did not even have Christmas here. Mwenda Mbijiwe was our everything," said Mwenda's mother Jane Gatwiri. She says the investigating authorities have not been forthright with them in dispensing information about the investigation. Mwenda Mbijiwe, a security analyst went missing in June 2021 as he travelled to Meru.
