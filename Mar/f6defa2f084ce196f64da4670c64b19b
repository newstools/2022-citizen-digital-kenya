Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka now says
he considered the age factor between him and ODM leader Raila Odinga before
deciding to put aside his own presidential ambitions and suppot the former
premier. Kalonzo, 68, was speaking at the
Jacaranda Grounds in Nairobi on Saturday shortly after putting his weight behind
Odinga, 77, under the Azimio La Umoja movement. “Kusema kweli, mimi nilikuwa
tayari kabisa, na nadhani bado niko tayari. Lakini tunaangalia umri,” he stated. The former Vice President stated
that he and Odinga had come a long way in the political stage and that the ODM
chief is the sure candidate to clinch presidency in the August polls due to the
strong team behind him. “Leo tumefanya a grand coalition
kwa jina Azimio-One Kenya…tuko na three important pillars; pillar ya Jubilee,
pillar ya OKA, na pillar ya ODM,” Kalonzo said. “Ndugu Raila tumetoka mbali, tumekula
teargas. Tulianza LDP, alafu ODM Kenya, NARC, CORD hadi NASA… Kwa roho safi, Raila
Amolo Odinga tosha!” Kalonzo further pledged that his
focus from now on will be on popularizing Odinga’s bid across the country. “Kuenda na mbele itakuwa hiari ya
Raila Odinga, mimi nitamtafutia kura Kenya nzima,” he said. President Uhuru Kenyatta congratulated
Kalonzo on backing Odinga, terming his move as a heroic act of selflessness. “Wengi wameweka kando tamaa ama
ambitions zao kwa sababu wanataka kuona Kenya ikishikana, mmoja wao akiwa ndugu
yangu Kalonzo Musyoka,” said President Kenyatta. “Ameweka tamaa yake chini kwa kulilia taifa
la Kenya…nataka tusimamame tumpigie makofi kwa sababu ya ushujaa wake.
Tunamshukuru na tunamwambia asante sana.” Saturday’s NDC saw over 20 affiliate parties
in attendance sign a coalition agreement to officially declare their alliance
to the Azimio la Umoja outfit.
