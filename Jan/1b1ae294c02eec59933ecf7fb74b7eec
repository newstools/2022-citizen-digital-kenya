Meru Senator Mithika Linturi will spend another night in police custody pending plea taking in a case where he is accused of making inciteful remarks during Deputy President William Ruto’s rally in Eldoret on Saturday. Linturi was presented at the Nakuru Law Courts on Monday where the prosecution led by State Counsel Jamsumba Onyango filed an application to detain the Senator for seven days pending conclusion of investigations. Chief Magistrate Edna Nyaloti directed that Linturi be held at Kaptembwo Police Station until Tuesday morning. Linturi will be awaiting a bail ruling at the Nakuru Law Courts. The Senator was arrested in an Eldoret hotel on Sunday morning following a directive by Director of Public Prosecution Noordin Haji to Inspector General of Police Hilary Mutyambai. Mutyambai was instructed to investigate the matter and forward the findings to the DPP’s office by January 14. Linturi has meanwhile, been under fire over the Saturday comments, which have been construed as advocating for tribal segregation. His UDA counterparts however in a Monday statement, bowed to pressure over his remarks stating that they are ready to comply with the DPP’s office in providing what is required to ensure justice is served.
