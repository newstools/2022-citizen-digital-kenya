Azimio la Umoja One Kenya presidential
candidate Raila Odinga now says there will be no election unless the Independent
Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) adopts both the manual and
electronic voter register. Odinga cited alleged plans by the Wafula
Chebukati-led commission to interfere with the forthcoming election, hence
insisting that both registers must be available. The Azimio chief, who was addressing a rally
in Githunguri during a charm offensive in Kiambu County on Wednesday, said the manual
register in all polling stations is an irreducible minimum for his camp. “With a manual register, it will be easy to
tell how many people have voted in every polling station. In the electronic
register, there is no record that remains,” said Odinga. “That is why we’re saying that there must be
a manual register at every polling station, it is not negotiable. We’re telling
the IEBC they must have a manual register along with the biometric
identification of voters on that day; failure to which, there will be no
election.” Odinga said he has sufficient and reliable
information that there is a plot to print excess pre-marked ballot papers in a
neighboring country then sneak them in on election day. The Azimio leader and his running mate Martha
Karua pleaded with electorates to give them a mandate to run the country after
President Uhuru Kenyatta's retirement in August.  Karua, on her part, said the Azimio
government - if elected - will stand for the right of everyone but strict on
misdoings specifically on graft.
