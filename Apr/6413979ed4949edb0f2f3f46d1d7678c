Police in Kayole gunned down two
suspected gang members as four others fled with severe gunshot injuries.    According to a report issued by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) on Friday, the attackers stabbed and injured the man as he was walking home
after which they robbed him of his belongings.    “Two officers based at Soweto police station who were on
foot patrol responded to the distress calls on time, as the boisterous gang took
leave casually, having accomplished their mission." The Kayole six, as identified by the DCI, retaliated by
shooting at the sleuths who responded and a shootout ensued leading to the
killing of the two gang members. “As a result, two of the thugs were fatally wounded as their
four accomplices fled the scene heavily inflicted with gunshot injuries. One
firearm and a bloodstained knife used in attacking the innocent civilian were
recovered from the suspects,” DCI explained. With the help of members of the public who witnessed the
incident, the injured civilian was taken to a city hospital where he was
admitted in critical condition. The bodies of the slain thugs have since been moved to the
city mortuary pending identification. Meanwhile, a manhunt continues for the four suspects
who escaped.
