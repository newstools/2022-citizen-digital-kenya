Kenya Kwanza running mate Rigathi
Gachagua has claimed that preparations to swear in the coalition’s presidential
flagbearer William Ruto in Nyeri County after the August elections are already
in top gear. Gachagua, who made the remarks on
Tuesday during the burial of his elder brother, alleged that the area residents
are ready for a DP Ruto presidency. The Mathira Member of Parliament,
on a light note, also told the DP that a committee has already
been formed to oversee his coronation at the Sagana State Lodge should he win
the presidential polls. “Hawa
wamesema watakupigia kura lakini hawataki kuja Nairobi ukiapishwa, wanasema wafunguliwe
State Lodge na kuwekwe runinga. Hata kuna kamati imetengenezwa,” he said. “Wamesema
ng’ombe ya kuchinjwa ni 35 na mbuzi na mchele na soda, ata wameweka mtu wa vote
of thanks tayari. Kwa hivyo sisi sherehe tutafanyia hapa.” Gachagua
also urged the Kenya Kwanza frontman to form a cordial relationship with the
people of Nyeri County and the larger Mt. Kenya region should he emerge
victorious at the August polls. The
MP alleged that President Uhuru Kenyatta fell short when it came to forming
binding relationships with the people of Nyeri during his presidency despite
occasionally frequenting the Sagana State Lodge. According
to Gachagua, the Head of State would only secretly and briefly visit the lodge then
return to Nairobi without interacting with locals who he said played a vital
role in securing President Kenyatta the top seat during the 2013 and 2017
General Elections. “Your
excellency (DP Ruto), kwa sababu utachaguliwa tunakuomba any one time unakuja
hapa State Lodge unafungua milango unapika chakula, watu wanakuja huko
wanakula, wanakuambia kwaheri  na wanaenda,” he said.  “Hiyo
haijafanyika. Uhuru ni wetu na ni wa hapa lakini kwa miaka kuni hakuna mtu
amefunguliwa hiyo milango.”
