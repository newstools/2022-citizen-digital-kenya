 According to Museveni, Uganda's past leadership, particularly the colonialists poisoned the minds of the hardworking farmes by making them grow the crops they (colonialists) wanted. “When the colonials came here, they made our people grow the crops they wanted: cotton, tobacco, coffee, tea, and then our leaders just copied what the colonialists told them...So, when I studied the issue, I could see danger, number one was only working for the stomach," "The locals must work for the stomach and the pocket. But secondly, even the ones who are working for the pocket do so without cura (calculations). That is how you get West Nile growing tobacco. If you grow tobacco on one acre, you will never get out of poverty…” Museveni was quoted by the Monitor as saying. Museveni who has been at the helm, for at least 35 years, made the remarks while addressing leaders from the Acholi and Lango sub-regions at Baralegi State Lodge in Otuke District on Saturday. He implored the farmers to select profitable avenues of farming such as coffee, fruits, poultry and pig-farming. “You should select enterprises which have a big demand within Uganda, Africa and internationally,” he added. According to opportunity international, a global nonprofit organization, 41 percent of Uganda's 44.3 million population lives in abject poverty. About 76 percent of the entire population lives in rural areas, with at least 73 of the entitre county's workforce working in the Agriculture sector.
