City
businesswoman Agnes Kagure has been cleared by the Independent Electoral and
Boundaries Commision (IEBC) to contest for the Nairobi gubernatorial seat. Ms. Kagure
who is vying on an independent ticket has also unveiled Abel Onchari Oyieyo as
her running mate. “I am a
firm believer in the youth's potential to lead. This is why I settled on the
youthful Abel Onchari Oyieyo as my running mate/DG,” Kagure wrote on Twitter on
Sunday. She
described him as a young leader who brings youthful zeal and insight to their
quest to occupy City Hall’s top seat. Kagure
recently dismissed reports suggesting that she has dropped her bid in favour of
Polycarp Igathe, whom Jubilee Party gave a ticket to vie in the election. She now
becomes the first independent candidate vying for the governor seat in Nairobi. Also in the
race for Nairobi’s top seat are Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Coalition’s allied
leaders, including Igathe, and Johnson Sakaja of the Kenya Kwanza Alliance.
