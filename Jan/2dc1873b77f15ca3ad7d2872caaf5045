 Kirinyaga Woman Representative Wangui Ngirici has announced that she will be vying for Kirinyaga gubernatorial seat in the August polls on an independent ticket. Speaking on Saturday in Kirinyaga, Ngirici maintained that she was determined to fight for the seat alone after defecting from DP William Ruto’s United Democratic Alliance (UDA) Party in December. “I am running as an independent candidate and I have made that very clear. Mimi sibanduki, hii msimamo naenda nauyo mpaka August 9,” said Ngirici. In what seemed as jabs targeted to DP Ruto’s camp, Ngirici cautioned big parties against looking down upon smaller parties. “Do not insult us for not being in parties, or go around dismissing parties which are not as big as yours, labelling them ‘village parties’,” said Ngirici. “These ‘village parties’ ndizo zitaleta leaders kwa National Assembly, the Senate, na hata governors,” added the legislator. Ngirici further noted that Kirinyaga people will not elect leaders being imposed on them by the bullish leaders. “Mtikata endeleeni kututukana but that will be at the disadvantage of the person you are pushing to us, hatutamchagua,” she stated. Ngirici also said that she is fully behind the Political Parties Amendment Bill, saying it will help small parties to grow. “This is a bill that is progressive, inahakikisha kuwa these so-called village parties ziko na say katika kugawa kwa pesa. Wale wanasema is is not good, ni kwa sababu ya their own selfishness na hawataki maendeleo,” she said. The Woman Representative had been a close ally of William Ruto until late October when her rival and current Kirinyaga Governor Ann Waiguru, who is also seeking another term, decamped to UDA. There was speculation about a possible plan to join ODM leader Raila Odinga’s camp earlier this month when Ngirici posted a chummy birthday message to the presidential aspirant a day prior to his birthday.
