Police in Kahawa West, Kiambu County are currently on the hunt
for a security guard alleged to have stabbed a man to death for failing to remit a Ksh. 20 parking fee. According to police, the suspect only
identified as Saluni demanded the fee from the victim who had parked his
motorcycle next to an ongoing construction project that the guard was manning in the wee hours of Friday morning. “Seeing that the motorcycle owner was adamant and ready to rev
up his wheels, Saluni brandished a suspected Somali sword from his Maasai
shuka, driving it into the victim's belly before scampering off,” the
Directorate of Criminal Investigations said in a statement. The victim was rushed to Kenyatta University Teaching, Referral and
Research Hospital by good Samaritans who heeded his cries for help but was
unfortunately pronounced dead on arrival.  Crime
scene officers have already documented the scene while the deceased’s body has
since been moved to the Kenyatta University Hospital morgue.
