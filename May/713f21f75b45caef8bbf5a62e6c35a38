Kenyan
musician Bahati will now fly the Jubilee Party flag in the race for Mathare
constituency Member of Parliament at the August General Elections. This is
after the ruling party reversed a previous zoning agreement with ODM which would've seen incumbent MP Anthony Oluoch remain the solo candidate in the race from the larger Azimio la Umoja One Kenya coalition party. “We’re happy to have Bahati with us as a
young man, representing everything you think about this country in terms of
even people who work hard from nowhere. It shows that you have an equal
opportunity in this country,” said Mr. Kioni. On his
part, the artist expressed his gratitude to the party and the Azimio coalition for the opportunity to run for the MP position. Bahati, who
recently decried being coerced to shelve his ambition for Mr. Oluoch citing claims that the area was zoned for the Raila Odinga-led ODM party, said he was confident of clinching the seat come
August. “Najua kulikuwa
na mambo mengi but just to confirm that I am on the ballot with the Jubilee
ticket and I can promise that I am the next Member of Parliament in Mathare and
thank you so much for the opportunity to run,” he said. Bahati who made the headlines after breaking down in tears as he expressed his recension at Jubilee
weeks ago, interestingly said he would not shed a tear. “Leo
sitalia na niko na furaha. I would like to thank the President, my party leader for
giving the youth of this country an opportunity to be leaders and represent
our communities. People of Mathare are happy,” he remarked. He similarly
exuded confidence to Azimio coalition leader Raila Odinga
for the opportunity as he promised to drum up support for the party in the
country.  “I want to thank Baba for considering a young person despite the zoning. Mathare MP will
definitely go to the Azimio team. I will go outside there as Kenya's most-followed musician to bring change to Mathare,” he noted.
