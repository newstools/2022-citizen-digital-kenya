   Addressing the Maa community on Saturday, Kalonzo said no clause in the Azimio la Umoja manifesto called for the banning of Mitumba business.  Instead, he said the coalition supports the mitumba business and its people.  “He (Raila) said that Mitumba will still be there, but will be made in Kenya by our factories as we improve on cotton farming,” he said.  Kalonzo urged opponents to focus on other issues as Azimio respects the Mitumba business.  During the launch of the Azimio manifesto on Monday, Raila Odinga was quoted saying that the mitumba clothes imported to Kenya could have been worn by dead people overseas.  The issue sparked a heated debate on media platforms, with William Ruto allied politicians saying that Raila was against the trade.  At a business forum on Tuesday, Raila clarified on the issue, saying he is not against the Mitumba business.  "Mitumba is not a dead-end business and it has created employment for so many of our people. I am defending them and there are people who are bringing propaganda to say that Raila is going to kill the sector. No, that is not the case," Raila said.
