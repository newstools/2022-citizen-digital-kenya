A
skeleton of a Gorgosaurus dinosaur is going up
for auction for the first time and is expected to fetch between $5 million (approx. Ksh.590 million) and
$8 million (approx. Ksh.944 million), Sotheby's said Tuesday. The auction house will put
the specimen, which is 10 feet tall (three meters) and 22 feet long, under the
hammer in New York on July 28. Sotheby's described the
skeleton as "one of the most valuable dinosaurs to ever appear on the
market." The Gorgosaurus roamed the
earth approximately 77 million years ago. A typical adult weighed
about two tonnes, slightly smaller than its more famous relative, the
Tyrannosaurus rex. Paleontologists say it was
fiercer and faster than the T-Rex, with a stronger bite of around 42,000
newtons compared to 35,000. The skeleton was discovered
in the Judith River Formation near Havre, in the US state of Montana in 2018. The sale will mark the
first time that Sotheby's has auctioned a full dinosaur skeleton since it sold
Sue the T-Rex in 1997 for $8.36 million. "All of the other
specimens of Gorgosaurus that have been found are in museums," Cassandra
Hatton, Sotheby's head of Science and popular culture, told AFP. "This is the only one
that you can actually buy so it's an exciting moment, both for private
collectors and institutions," she added.  Unlike other countries, the
United States does not restrict the sale or export of fossils, meaning the
skeleton could end up overseas.
