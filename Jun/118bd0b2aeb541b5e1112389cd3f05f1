Nairobi gubernatorial hopeful Polycarp Igathe has left his supporters gazing at his next move after he took his vote-seeking mission to the county’s toilets.  Igathe, who has made headlines in recent months for his political antics with running mate Phillip Kaloki, emphasized the importance of keeping the toilets clean. He reiterated his commitment to building more toilets in the country's capital if elected in August.  “The management of public toilets should be transparent, fair and effective. There should be more public toilets in market areas, bus stops and around the CBD so that we protect the sanitation of the people and the environment. Nairobi will be a clean and bright City!” He wrote on Twitter.   While defending his acts, Igathe says that his leadership aims at service delivery in a more personal way. "People should get used to seeing me because that is how things will be even when I become governor. I will be serving you your menu, not the menu of the chef," Igathe said last week. “It all boils down to basic service delivery for the people. This is something that comes out clearly in our manifesto that we will be launching very soon, a manifesto for the people.”  All the three candidates have already been cleared by the Independent Electoral and boundaries Commission (IEBC).
