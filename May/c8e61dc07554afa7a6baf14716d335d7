In her report for the year ended June 30, 2021, Gathungu said the State Department for Correctional Services entered into a contract with a local
contractor for the construction of the perimeter wall for Ksh24.8 million on April 4, 2017 by use of restricted tender. "A letter of notification of award
was issued to the contractor who accepted the offer on 3 April, 2017 with the contract
signed on 4 April, 2017 contrary to Section 135(3) of the Public Procurement and Asset
Disposal Act, 2015 which requires the contract to be signed within the period specified in
the notification of award but not before fourteen days following the notification," the report said. Gathungu noted that although the scheduled contract period was for a duration of 16 weeks
from May 4, 2017, the actual construction works started on April 21, 2017, and stalled on December 23, 2017. "It was later reported that on 24 July, 2018 at 1350
hours, 95 meters of the wall collapsed in the area between watch tower 2 and 3 as a
result of which an officer manning the watch tower 2 at the time sustained injuries." Construction works resumed later, however, the contractor abandoned the site when
the works were at 60 per cent complete, Gathungu noted. She noted that records further indicated that
the Prisons Department on several occasions raised concerns about the workmanship but no action was taken. As a result of poor workmanship and delays, another 130 meters
of the second perimeter wall on the southern side collapsed on July 25, 2021, compromising the security of the inmates and staff. "A site visit in October 2021 confirmed that the collapsed wall was not
reconstructed and the contractor was not on site." The report states that detailed payments made to date were
not provided for audit verification and management has not provided adequate
explanations for the anomalies noted. "Consequently, value for money from the expenditure in respect of the stalled project could
not be ascertained."
