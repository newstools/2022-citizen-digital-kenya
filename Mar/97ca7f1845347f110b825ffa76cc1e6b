Businessman
Jimi Wanjigi was on Wednesday afternoon briefly detained and grilled at the
Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) headquarters on Kiambu road. This after the DCI late last
month summoned
the business magnate-turned-politician and ordered him to surrender 10 firearms
and over 480 rounds of ammunition in his possession. Wanjigi,
who presented himself to the investigative agency in the company of his lawyer
Willis Otieno, was held for a few hours. The
businessman however said some of the firearms being sought are in the custody
of the police themselves, further blaming his political rivals for his
tribulations. “Our
client’s firearms were illegally confiscated by DCI in 2017. We went to court
and the court ordered that the said firearms be returned to our client. We
supplied the DCI with the court order,” said lawyer Otieno. “As
at today, those firearms have not been returned to our client, and that is now
the subject of an ongoing case before the Court of Appeal.” Wanjigi,
on his part, said: “The thing with witch hunts is that they have an end…people
call you to fish around to see what they can get to try and charge you. There’s
nothing, and we’re prepared for whatever they want to throw at us.” In
a summon notice issued on February 21, the DCI said the firearms are illegally
held and that the businessman does not possess any firearm certificate. The DCI further faulted Wanjigi
for failing to appear before the Firearm Licencing Board on November 26 last
year for the vetting. Among the firearms the
businessman is accused of illegally possessing are a CQ, Glock, Ceska pistol,
Shotgun, Glock 19, and a Gilboa.  Citing the recent raid at
Wanjigi’s Kwacha House offices in Nairobi, the DCI further stated that Wanjigi
has an armed ex-GSU officer previously attached to the Recce squad as his
bodyguard.
