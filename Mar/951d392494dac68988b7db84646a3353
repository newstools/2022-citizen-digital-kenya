Simiyu is the new Secretary General of the Democratic Action Party-Kenya (DAP-K). He
replaces Bernard Masanja who has been appointed the party's second deputy party
leader. Ayub
Savula is the first deputy party leader, while Wafula Wamunyinyi retains the
position of party leader. The
party says the new appointment is in line with its National Delegates
Convention (NDC) resolutions. The
party also says it has attracted over 1,500 aspirants. “1,556
people have shown interest to run on our party. This is not a small number, you
cannot say we’re a small party in this country; we’ve joined the big ranks,”
said Wamunyinyi.  Eseli
on his part stated: “I would like to dispel rumors that there has been any
resistance in the chance of the leadership of the party. Those were political
rumors, because the party was growing very fast and some people are very scared
so they can throw any spanner in the works.”
