Since Monday, June 20, Commonwealth leaders have been flocking to the Rwandan capital for the global summit which was originally to take place in 2020 but was twice postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales – who is representing Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, the head of the Commonwealth – arrived in Kigali for the summit of the Commonwealth leaders on Tuesday accompanied by Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cornwall. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau arrived in Kigali on Wednesday night while his British counterpart Boris Johnson arrived on Thursday.
