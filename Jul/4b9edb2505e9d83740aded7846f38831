Senior Counsel Paul Muite has come out to address claims that
he is unwell and ailing from Cancer. Muite, in a tweet posted on Friday afternoon, sought to
clarify the social media reports saying he is in fact very fit and has – matter of factly – never been in better shape
in his life. The Safina party boss stated that he had personally come to the
decision to lose some weight, adding that he even jogs in the morning now. “Reports on social media that I am sick with cancer are not
true. Given my age, I have had to shed off weight on purpose to keep sugar
levels where they should be otherwise I have never felt better; enjoyed 1 &
1/2 hrs jogging in Ngong forest this morning,” he wrote. This comes after an image of a seemingly frail-looking Muite,
posing next to an unidentified woman, went viral on Twitter on Friday alongside
a caption that seemed to suggest that he was not doing well. Twitter user Abdulahi Adan shared the photo and captioned it:
“This picture of second liberation icon, Paul Muite
has touched my heart. Cancer one day you too will die. Quick Recovery Paul
Muite.” The tweet opened the floodgates to a myriad of ‘get well soon’
messages from Kenyans on Twitter, thereby making Muite a trending topic.
