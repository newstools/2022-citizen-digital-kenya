 ODM leader Raila Odinga's chopper was on Friday pelted with stones by rowdy youth in Kabenes, Uasin Gishu County. Odinga and other leaders allied to the Azimio La Umoja movement were in the area to attend the burial of businessman Jackson Kibor. "In the event that took place at Kabenes in Uasin Gishu, youth attacked my plane, destroying the air shield with rocks that were clearly aimed at me. On my way to the plane, they had pelted my vehicles with stones," said Odinga in a statement.
