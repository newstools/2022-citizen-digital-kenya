 Awendo Sub-county police commander Mathias Pombo said they are yet to establish what transpired before the death of the 24-year-old who works at Tom Mboya Secondary School. Mr.Pombo said they are waiting for an autopsy to guide them in the probe into the death. “At the moment, we cannot establish whether he drowned or was killed and dumped there, only an autopsy ca tell us that,” he stated. The incident comes three days after a Sony Sugar Company employee was killed and the body dumped near Awendo Sub-county Hospital. The deaths have elicited reaction from the locals who are raising concern over a surge in cases of insecurity in the region. Migori County Police Commander Mark Wanjala, speaking during the Madaraka Day celebrations on Wednesday, said they are working on better modalities to deal with the cases of insecurity in Awendo, Rongo, and Suna East. “We have recorded three recent cases of robbery and gang rape by a goup of thugs which has been roaming around,” he said. Mr.Wanjala said they have heightened patrols in insecurity hotspots and called on the members of the public to work closely with the police to avert cases of insecurity.
