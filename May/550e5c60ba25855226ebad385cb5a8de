A middle-aged man has reportedly killed his
four-year-old daughter before committing suicide at a lodge in Piai, Mwea East, Kirinyaga County. Confirming the incident, Mwea East sub-county
Police Commander Daniel Kitavi said the man booked the lodge with his
daughter on Friday. Kitavi said the man, whose wife is an officer
based at Wang’uru Police Station, is suspected to have poisoned the girl before 
hanging himself  at the bar counter. “The deceased’s wife is my officer and we are
worried why the young man, who is employed at a private hospital in Ngurubani, decided to kill himself and his daughter,” said the police boss.  The two bodies have since been taken to
Kerugoya Referral Hospital for postmortem as investigations begin.
