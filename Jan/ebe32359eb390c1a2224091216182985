A day after rowdy youths disrupted a United Democratic Alliance (UDA) rally at the Jacaranda Grounds in Embakasi East, the party that is affiliated to Deputy President William Ruto has insisted that heads must roll. UDA party chairman Johnson Muthama blamed the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) in a statement to the media on Monday, claiming that the stone-throwing mob was on ODM's payroll. "A similar incident took place in Kitale where members of parliament allied to UDA were disrupted by the police from having a peaceful meeting," Muthama said "This is not the first time these ugly scenes have occurred.  On 5th September 2021, in Kieni  Nyeri County, the Deputy President’s motorcade was stoned and barely two months later in a more brazen attack the Deputy President motorcade was also stoned in Kondele Kisumu County on 10th  October 2021," ODM has demonstrated, according to UDA, that it will use violence as part of its strategy to clich the top seat in several separate incidents. The DP Ruto-aligned party has now demanded that the Interior Ministry and the National Police Service investigate the incident and prosecute those found responsible. "Kenyans are watching to see whether Interior cabinet Secretary Dr Fred Matiangi, who has publicly supported Mr Raila Odinga quest for presidency will  drop his political hat and act to save Kenyans from his political master’s crusade for violence. This trend is not acceptable, "  Muthama added. CS Matiang'i, according to the UDA, has "continued to remain silent and is in no doubt emerging as a cheerleader of such intolerant and unacceptable behavior." The party says it will be writing to the IG, to know the progress of the investigations, and the action that has been taken. The party also accused Raila of planning the election and the political discourse on his terms, 'centered around violence, conflict, confrontation and threat and leaning heavily on government protection' .
