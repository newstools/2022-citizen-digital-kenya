A popular nightclub in Westlands is now on
the spot after it emerged that a reveler was beaten to death by the establishment’s
bouncers and his body thrown just a few meters away. Charles Chege is said to have been descended
upon by two of the club’s bouncers on March 5 over allegations that he stole
another reveler’s phone. The bouncers are seen in a video beating the father
of three senseless using pipes and sticks, in between blows and kicks. The beating is said to have continued for a
period estimated at around 3 hours, before tossing his lifeless body by the roadside,
outside the joint, where it was found by police. Autopsy has since revealed the cause of death
as multiple injuries sustained due to blunt force trauma. Anne Fataki, the deceased’s sister, told the K24
investigations desk that: “That’s where the body was discovered by Kileleshwa
police. They took the body at 8am to the City Mortuary and identified it as ‘unknown.’” “The guy was beaten to death. All the ribs and
legs were broken…it’s like they hit him with a blunt object on the head, and he
had blood clots all over the body.” Hellen Njeri, the deceased’s mother, on her
part said: “Sina kijana mwingine, alikuwa ni huyo tu, lakini nimewasamehe wenye
walifanya hivo. Hiyo ingine watamalizana na Mungu wao. Ata angekuwa amefanya
makosa, labda wangempeleka kwa polisi.” Eight employees of the club have since been
arrested following the incident, among them; the manager, two bouncers and 5
other staffers. They were presented before a Nairobi court on
Monday and detained at the Kilimani Police Station for another 14 days to allow
for completion of investigations into the incident.
