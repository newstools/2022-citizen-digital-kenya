 According to police, the lorry transporting laborers is owned by a Chinese Manufacturing company and was attempting to cross the tracks but underestimated the speed and distance of the oncoming train. Five of the lorry's passengers attempted to avoid the impending collision by jumping from the vehicle, but were knocked down by the train. Five people died on the spot, according to Kiambu County Police Commander Muchangi Kioi, while 12 others are receiving medical attention after suffering serious injuries. The aftermath of the horrific crash was captured in several photographs; the lorry's driver cabin, as well as the rest of its body, was completely mangled. The number of people in the lorry at the time of the accident was not immediately known, with the flash crowd that gathered soon after giving police officers a hard time after claiming that more people were trapped beneath the train.
