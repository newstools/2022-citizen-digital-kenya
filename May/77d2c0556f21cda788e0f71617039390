A Muslim cleric who was charged with terrorism in 2018
shocked a Nairobi court on Thursday after he declined to leave prison despite
being acquitted. Sheikh Guyo Gorsa, a former Madrassa teacher in Marsabit,
told Magistrate Wendy Muchemi that he was not ready to leave Kamiti Maximum
Prison since he feared for his life. Gorsa claimed that he would be executed by government agents
hence asked to remain in custody until an application he filed at the High
Court to be granted State protection is determined. Magistrate Wendy Muchemi agreed with Gorsa’s application but
for a period of 30 days in which he will pay for remand services. The accused was arrested in 2018 by the Anti Terror Police
Unit and was subsequently accused of being an Al Shabaab operative, using his
position as a religious leader in Marsabit to recruit youths into the outlawed
group.
