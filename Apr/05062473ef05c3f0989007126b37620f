The United States does not believe that there is a threat of
Russia using nuclear weapons despite a recent escalation in Moscow's rhetoric,
a senior U.S. defense official said on Friday. "We continue to monitor
their nuclear capabilities every day the best we can and we do not assess that
there is a threat of the use of nuclear weapons and no threat to NATO
territory," the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told
reporters. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei
Lavrov said on Monday the West should not underestimate the elevated risks of
nuclear conflict over Ukraine. Russia said earlier this month that it plans to deploy its
newly tested Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missiles, capable of mounting nuclear
strikes against the United States, by autumn. Western concern at the risk of nuclear war increased after
President Vladimir Putin launched Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 with
a speech in which he pointedly referred to Moscow's nuclear forces and warned
that any attempt to get in Russia's way "will lead you to such
consequences that you have never encountered in your history." British Prime Minister Boris
Johnson said this week he did not expect any further Russian military failures
in Ukraine to push Putin into using tactical nuclear weapons there, saying the
Russian leader had room to manoeuvre and end the conflict. Earlier this month CIA Director
William Burns said the threat of Russia potentially using tactical or low-yield
nuclear weapons in Ukraine could not be taken lightly, but that the CIA has not
seen a lot of practical evidence reinforcing that concern. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has
left thousands dead or injured, reduced towns and cities to rubble and forced
over 5 million people to flee abroad. Moscow calls its action a "special
operation" to demilitarise its neighbour.
