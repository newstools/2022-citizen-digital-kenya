 Balala said that the government is now planning to install water pans to help curb the water crisis and also prevent wildlife animals from invading surrounding neighbourhoods in search of water. "More than 70 elephants have died at the Tsavo National park because of drought. But we are now building water pans to prevent them from dying but also preventing them from going out of the park and attacking neighbouring citizens," noted Balala on Wednesday. The CS further said climate change has become a major challenge to conservation efforts as animals continue to be affected by drought. According to a 2021 census report, The Tsavo ecosystem is home to 14,964 elephants. The elephants, particularly young males, pregnant females and calves, are sensitive to water and food depletion and barely survive without the resources for a long period of time. This, studies explain, is why they invade human habitation or at times drink water from contaminated waterholes in a bid to survive. An adult elephant needs 225 litres of water and 140 kgs of food every day, and is more prone to complications.
