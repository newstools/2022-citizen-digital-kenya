Narc
Kenya party leader Martha Karua has taken to social media to address her
absence from Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party leader Raila Odinga’s big
day at KICC. Karua
was the only One Kenya Alliance (OKA) principal to skip the Azimio la Umoja
National Delegates Convention (NDC) at KICC, with Wiper’s Kalonzo Musyoka and
KANU’s Gideon Moi as well as UDM party boss Cyrus Jirongo all present. And,
as fate would have it, the NDC would serve as the platform for Kalonzo
to finally announce that he was putting aside his presidential ambitions in favour of Odinga, as well as that OKA had joined the Azimio la Umoja movement. However,
Karua’s voice to the matter remained silent following her absence, despite
being one of the names in a very short list of proposed leaders from the Mt.
Kenya region to deputise Odinga in the race to State House. Veteran
journalist David Makali was one of many Kenyans who noticed this conspicuous
absence, and sought to find out the iron lady’s whereabouts. “Where
is Martha Karua?” Posed Makali on Twitter. And,
in classic iron lady style, Karua replied: “Relaxing at home”   Odinga was on Saturday endorsed as the Azimio la Umoja
movement joint presidential candidate ahead of the August 9 polls. The NDC saw over 20 affiliate parties in attendance sign a coalition agreement to officially declare their alliance to the Azimio la
Umoja outfit.  Among
the parties were Wiper led by Kalonzo Musyoka, Gideon Moi’s KANU, Wafula
Wamunyinyi’s DAP-K, as well as Governor Alfred Mutua’s Maendeleo Chap Chap
among others.
