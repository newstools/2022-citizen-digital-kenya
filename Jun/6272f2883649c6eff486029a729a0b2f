Drama was on Tuesday witnessed in Mombasa after the Independent
Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) declined to clear former
Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko to vie for the county’s top seat. Mombasa County Returning Officer Swalhah
Yusuf said he had not received any directive from the commission Chairperson
Wafula Chebukati to clear Sonko for the August 9 contest. Swalhah also intimated that the three-judge
bench that was hearing Sonko’s case had not issued any clearance orders to IEBC
to facilitate a go-ahead for the former Nairobi Governor. The Returning Officer directed Sonko, his running mate Ali Mbogo and their team to seek reprieve from the IEBC Dispute Resolution Committee. The move caused a stand-off, with Sonko's
supporters camping outside the Kenya School of Government (KSG) for the
better part of the day into the evening. While in the company of his running mate Ali
Mbogo and his lawyers, Sonko vowed not to leave the premises until they’re given
a nod and issued with a certificate. Earlier on Tuesday, a three-judge bench of in
Mombasa lifted the court order barring IEBC from clearing Sonko for the race. So far, seven candidates in the race to
replace Governor Ali Hassan Joho for the county’s top job have been cleared.  Among them are Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir
(ODM), Mombasa Deputy Governor William Kingi (PAA), Daniel Munga (Independent),
former Nyali MP Awiti Bolo (VDP) and former Senator Hassan Omar (UDA).
