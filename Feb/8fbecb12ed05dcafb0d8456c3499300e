The suspects, Nixon Kinyua and Patrick Ngure, are said to
have abducted the Nazarene Sisters nun on February 5, 2022, before holding her hostage
for over four hours. They both pleaded not guilty and were released on bond. According to police reports, the nun, who was travelling from
Meru to Kiamuri, was waiting for a matatu at a bus stop, on the day in
question, when a grey Toyota Premio pulled over and offered her a ride. The driver of the automobile masqueraded as a good Samaritan
and convinced the nun to board his vehicle after claiming he was headed in her direction. “She
fell for the trap and took the front seat as they set off for the journey.
Along the way, the driver set the tempo to earn the nun’s confidence and
engaged her in a lengthy conversation, on how he grew up from humble beginnings
before being adopted by an Italian family,” the Directorate of Criminal
Investigations (DCI) said in a statement. Things
however quickly changed when the nun arrived at her destination and ask the
driver to pull over. Before the driver responded, the other suspect who had
conveniently stayed hidden in the back seat during the entire journey, moved to
blindfold and restrain the woman using a leso. “The two who had threatened to rape and
kill the nun if she failed to heed to their demands, took cash from her purse,
drained money from her M-Pesa account before coercing her to call her colleagues
to ask for more money,” the DCI added. After
exhausting all avenues to forcefully obtain money from the nun, the suspects
ditched her at a secluded area.  Once
the matter was reported to police, detectives from the Crime Research and
Intelligence Bureau conducted forensic analysis which led them to the two
suspects. They were nabbed along the Kitui-Kibwezi road.
