"Our campaign is aware that Kenyans are anxious to know the Azimio la Umoja One Kenya presidential ticket. We will make the announcement tomorrow," wrote Prof.Mutua. Three candidates from a list of 11 individuals recommended for the position were submitted to the coalition's flag bearer by the selection panel, after conducting a lengthy vetting process. The three names, the panel stated, had been submitted in order of priority. Candidates who appeared for vetting include Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka, Martha Karua (Narc-Kenya),Sabina Chege (Jubilee Party), Peter Kenneth (Jubilee Party) Ali Hassan Joho (ODM) and Stephen Tarus (National Liberal Party). Others are Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya, deputy ODM leader Wycliffe Oparanya and Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui. KANU Party chairman Gideon Moi who had earlier been shortlisted opted out of the race to endorse Kalonzo.
