 Parents were not left behind either on a day that saw the world celebrate not only intimate lovers but also family as well as friends in what has become to be known as Valentine's Day. The girls were also treated to cakes in an event that has now become an annual ritual at the school. In a school that has maintained high and strict standards in academics, this event is seen as a breather and an occasion to let oneself loose from the daily structured  routine The school, situated in Kikuyu, Kiambu County, has traditionally celebrated valentines day with its parents, students, teaching and non teaching staff, actively participating to make the day a great success always. This day is celebrated to incorporate unity and cohesion in the diverse community and to ensure that students from all walks of life are brought together as one.
