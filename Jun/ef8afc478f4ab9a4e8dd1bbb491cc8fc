The Ethics and
Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) has moved to court seeking to recover
Ksh.13,997,987 from Geoffrey Kimonge Mbogho, the one-time political advisor to
former Taita Taveta Governor John Mruttu. This follows a
complaint submitted to the commission on August 18, 2022 which claimed that
Mbogho, in his capacity, fraudulently held and used the cash which was set
aside as imprest for Taita Taveta County MCAs and staff. Following
subsequent investigations, EACC allegedly discovered that Mbogho purportedly
acquired the funds fraudulently between November 2015 and May 2017. "On 20th November,
2015 he fraudulently applied for and received imprest of Ksh.1 million
purportedly for allowances for Members of various County Assembly Wards within
the said County. He never paid the monies to the said Members of County
Assembly Wards," EACC said in a statement. "On 27th
November, 2015 he fraudulently applied for and received imprest of Ksh.1,070,000
purportedly for allowances for Members of various County Assembly Wards within
the said County. He never paid the monies to the said Members of County
Assembly Wards." Between October 9
and December 2015, Mbogho is said to have cumulatively obtained Ksh.1,795,200
meant to facilitate official county engagements. On diverse dates
between March 2016 and December 2016, he is also accused of falsely obtaining Ksh.6,244,790
under the same pretence, and failing to remit the same to county staff. “On 13th
December, 2016 he fraudulently applied for and received imprest of
Ksh.7,233,381 purportedly as daily subsistence allowance (per diem) for
employees of the said County Government traveling to Dubai," said EACC "Investigations
established that he never remitted Ksh.1,307,997 to some of the employees of
the said County and has never surrendered the imprest." On December 22, 2016,
Mbogho apparently also failed to remit Ksh.2 million imprest meant to
facilitate travel for ten county officials to Dubai. On May 17, 2017
the suspect is also accused of illegally obtaining Ksh.560,000 from the county. EACC has since
filed a suit at the Voi Law Courts seeking to have the funds returned in full
to the county government of Taita Taveta. "The
commission also wants an order of payment of interest at commercial rates of
Ksh.13,977,987 from the date of acquisition of each tranche as
enumerated above to the date of filing the suit, interest at court rates from
the date of filing suit till payment in full and for Mbogho to settle the costs
of and incidental to this suit," said EACC.
