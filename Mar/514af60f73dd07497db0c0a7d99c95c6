 The party led by Treasury Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani announced they will back Raila's bid to State House at the party's National Delegates Convention (NDC) held at the Bomas of Kenya on Wednesday. While making his speech, Odinga thanked the party's delegates for endorsing him reiterating his commitment to seeking the country's top job. "Nataka kutoa shukrani yangu ya dhati kwa wanachama wa UPIA kwa kupitisha kwa kauli moja kuniunga mkono kwa kugombea kiti ya urais kwa uchaguzi unaokuja. Nasema asante sana," he said. He also alluded that the March 2018 handshake between him and President Uhuru Kenyatta played a part in uniting the nation, demonstrating that he had the country’s best interest at heart. "Nataka tutembee pamoja. Maana ya handshake kati yangu na Uhuru Kenyatta ilikua kuunganisha wakenya wote wawe kitu kimoja ili tuweze kutekeleza ndoto ya taifa letu. Tukae na amani na undugu mahali hakuna ubaguzi ya kirangi, kikabila, kidini, kijinsia, kiumri sababu sote ni watu sawa," said Odinga. Also present at the NDC was Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka who has since joined Azimio la Umoja and declared support for Raila's presidential bid.
