 The building, which was partly demolished, is said to have been one of those under demolition by the Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) to pave the way for the Eastern by-pass expansion. Eyewitnesses say those trapped had gone into the condemned building to collect scrap metal. Rescue teams from Kiambu County are at the scene to retrieve those trapped.
