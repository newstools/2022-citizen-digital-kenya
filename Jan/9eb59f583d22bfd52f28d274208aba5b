The
French government is now warning its citizens in Kenya of a looming terror attack in Nairobi targeting
places frequented by foreigners. France’s
Ministry of Foreign Affairs hence cautioned its citizens as well as expatriates
from other Western countries to avoid public areas and crowded places it
classified as possible hotspots. These
include hotels, restaurants, leisure spots and commercial centers in the city. The
ministry, in a statement released on Thursday, called on foreigners living and
working in Nairobi to exercise extreme vigilance in the coming days, especially
over this weekend. The
German embassy has also issued a warning that over the next few days its
citizens in Kenya should pay special attention when out in public and be alert. These
are in addition to the general rules that the embassy has for its
nationals whenever they are out in public. The
United States government had on January 5, 2022 also issued a travel advisory
to its citizens to reconsider any planned trips to Kenya due to COVID-19.  The
U.S further urged its citizens already in Kenya to exercise increased caution due
to crime, terrorism, health issues, and kidnapping.
