 Rotich had petitioned to have the prosecution withdrawn from the case arguing that the DPP exercised his discretion without regard to the provisions of the constitution and other applicable laws. Milimani Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Division court judge Esther Maina ruled in favour of the DPP setting stage for the case to proceed. She said Rotich failed to convince the court to warrant stopping the DPP's case against him. "I have carefully considered his petition seeking to stop the trial but I find no justifiable reasons to terminate the case. In the end, I find no merit in the application and dismiss it in its entirety," Maina said. DPP Noordin Haji lauded the court's decision saying: "Justice Maina's decision in this matter today reinforces the DPP's discretion and independence in making the decision to charge, as guaranteed under Article 157 of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010." In the multi-billion shillings dam fraud case, the former CS alongside four others are charged with several counts of corruption, including conspiracy to defraud and abuse of office, which resulted in the loss of Ksh.63 billion in 2019.
