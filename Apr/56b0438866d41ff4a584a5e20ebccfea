Member of Parliament Abdulswamad Shariff Nassir is now the undisputed Orange
Democratic Movement (ODM) party flagbearer for the Mombasa gubernatorial race in
the August polls. Abdulswamad
was given the party ticket following negotiations that saw his political rival
and businessman Suleiman Shahbal drop his bid to support him. Shahbal
said that he resolved to back the lawmaker after the party leadership, led by
Raila Odinga, called for consensus-building to ensure ODM retains the ticket. “I
have been aspiring to be Mombasa governor for the last 10 years. But the
objective of becoming governor was not for Suleiman Shahbal but to bring change
and development to the people of Mombasa,” he said during a press address on
Friday evening. “It
is not important that I lead those changes, what is important is that those
changes happen and today we have decided to work with Abdulswamad to make sure
those changes happen.” The
legislator, on his part, lauded the move by Shahbal to back his candidature
saying they would work together to ensure the success of the Coastal county. “I
want to thank my ODM party leaders and my brother Suleiman for agreeing to work
together. He has been a worthy competitor and we have agreed that we will work
together so that we accomplish our vision,” Abdulswamad said.  In
the race to succeed incumbent Governor Ali Hassan Joho, Nassir will now face
off with UDA's Omar Hassan and Wiper's candidate, who could be former Nairobi
Governor Mike Sonko or Kisauni MP Ali Mbogo.
