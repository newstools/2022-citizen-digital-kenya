 Speaking during a campaign tour in Kibra constituency on Sunday, Karua vowed that the Azimio camp will address the sanitary conditions experienced in the region and low living standards. In Nairobi, Karua added, Igathe will be held responsible if he fails to execute his mandate to the satisfaction of city residents. "I have only one message to Igathe. If these people give you your votes to be the governor of Nairobi we don't want to come here and see litters all over," said Karua. "We want to see you working. And let me tell you if you fail to do that work Raila's whip will land on you. The Azimio government will work to ensure that your environs and standards of living have changed." On his part, Raila Odinga called on Kibra residents to unanimously vote for him and Azimio candidates. Terming Kibra as his 'bedroom' Raila noted that he expects all votes from the area to be casted in his favor during the August polls. "I want you to come out in huge numbers and spread the news that Kibra is my bedroom and I know my votes are here. I want my votes from here to be 100%," Raila said. Raila likewise told his supporters to give him most votes for Lang'ata constituency where  Felix Odiwour alias Jalang'o is the ODM candidate.
