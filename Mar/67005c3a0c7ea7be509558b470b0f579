A 34-year-old Kenyan national has been arrested by detectives
in connection to a string of robberies that has seen a number of new generation
passports disappear from various job recruitment agencies. According to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI),
the passports are usually sold to illegal West African immigrants for around Ksh.22,000 apiece. The suspect, Stephen Obiero, was arrested by sleuths who
posed as pidgin speaking West Africans before luring Obiero out in the open
with the promise of buying the in-demand documents from him. “The
detectives who had done their homework posed as pidgin speaking West Africans
and lured the thug to a matatu along Mfangano Street, where the transaction
took place,” the DCI said in a statement. “Unbeknownst
to the thug, he was dealing with multilingual undercover agents, speaking a
mixture of Yoruba and broken English.” The
suspect was arrested immediately after finalizing the deal with the undercover
detectives. Obiero, the DCI says, was found in possession of 22 passports
belonging to young female Kenyans who had deposited them at recruitment agencies
in the hopes of landing jobs in the Middle East.  DCI
is currently tracking down the owners of the recovered travel documents while
the suspect is being held at Central Police Station awaiting arraignment on
Monday.
