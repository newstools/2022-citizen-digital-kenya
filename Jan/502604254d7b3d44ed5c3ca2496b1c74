 Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party leader
Raila Odinga has advised Meru Senator Mithika Linturi to refrain from making
comments that may be perceived as hate speech or advocating for tribal
segregation. According to Odinga, such remarks are
dangerous and they may put the future of Kenya in jeopardy especially with the
August-slated polls fast approaching. Odinga was speaking in Tigania East, Meru
County on Wednesday when he attended the funeral service of 7 persons killed by
cattle rustlers suspected to hail from the neighbouring Isiolo County,
following a night raid on January 5, 2022. Leaders present during the burial included
Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi, Senator Mithika Linturi and Agriculture Cabinet
Secretary Peter Munya among others. “Nimeona Senator wenu amefika hapa. Kabla
hajaongea hapa, mambo ya madoadoa awachane nayo. Hakuna madoadoa katika taifa
letu. Kila Mkenya ni Mkenya kila mahali, anaweza kuishi kila mahali katika
taifa letu,” Odinga said during his address after noticing that Senator Linturi
was preparing to take the podium. Odinga similarly chimed in on the ongoing
border dispute between Meru and Isiolo Counties, which has largely been
identified as the reason behind the banditry attacks being witnessed in the
area. “We can’t allow persons to randomly come to
where unarmed civilians are and shoot people dead before fleeing. The police
claim to not know where these firearms are hidden but it is their duty to trace
and apprehend such persons,” he said. “We cannot tolerate such incidences because
the border between the two counties has already been mapped. I suggest that we
have military patrols around the area to maintain the peace.” On his part Governor Murungi underscored that
he was currently working in tandem with the region’s police commander to have
firearms confiscated from 20 youth who served as reservists returned so that
they can maintain peace in the area.
