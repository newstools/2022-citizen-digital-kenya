 Businesswoman
Mary Wambui was on Wednesday arrested for allegedly being in possession of an
unregistered firearm. Wambui
was nabbed and questioned by detectives before being taken to the Muthaiga
Police Station where she is being detained. The
controversial businesswoman is set to be arraigned in court on Thursday. The Purma Holdings director was previously arrested, arraigned and released
on a Ksh.50 million bond and a surety of Ksh.25 million after pleading not
guilty to charges of alleged tax evasion amounting to Ksh.2.2 billion. Upon
her release, the
Firearms Licensing Board ordered the businesswoman to surrender a firearm she
was illegally in possession of; a CZ 75 semi-automatic pistol. The firearms regulator, in a demand letter seen by Citizen
Digital then, claimed that Wambui’s licence to carry the weapon had expired. Wambui,
the very next day, surrendered the CZ 75 semi-automatic pistol to Runda Police
Station for forwarding to the Firearms Licensing Board on her behalf. While
submitting the gun, she claimed that she had initially intended to renew the
expired licence but found the authority's offices closed.  She
also alleged that she later travelled outside the country which further
derailed her intention to restore the operating permit.
