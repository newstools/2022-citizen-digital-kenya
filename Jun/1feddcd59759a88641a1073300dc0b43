Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu now says that
her decision not to seek re-election was influenced by her desire to help
empower fellow women in the country. Speaking during the launch of the Ushanga
Kenya Initiative on Friday, Ngilu intimated that her passion to see women's
economic strength improved led to her backing out of the race. “I stepped down because I want to support
women on a national level,” Ngilu said. The Narc party leader noted that her position
in politics had seen her serve more than three decades, hence it was time to
hand over the mantle to other leaders. "Remember I have been in the leadership
position for over 30 years, it is now time to move forward and give young women
a chance and also be part and parcel of the building of their capacity,” she
said. The Kitui County boss further noted that she had
to consult her community people before going public with the news that she was
now heading to national politics. “This cannot just be announced that I'm
exiting, you have to call people and prepare and they bless me and they tell me
to go on. So I can't make a decision like this alone," Ngilu explained. Ngilu withdrew her re-election bid in support
of the first Kitui Governor Julius Malombe on June 15 during an Azimio la Umoja
One Kenya campaign tour of the region. Azimio presidential flagbearer Raila Odinga
made the announcement that she would not be defending her seat in the August
general elections as he would be working with her on the national level.
