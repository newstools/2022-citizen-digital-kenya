Interior Cabinet
Secretary Dr Fred Matiang’i has warned chiefs and their assistants who demand
bribes to release title deeds saying that those caught will be sacked. CS Matiang'i said
that the government will be issuing the title deeds in the ongoing process free
of charge and that any administrator found culpable of soliciting bribes or any
other incentives to land owners would face the law. “These
administrators have been tasked with overseeing the distribution of the titles
to their owners. We have made it very clear that no one should pay a penny for
their title. We won’t entertain any rent-seeking through this exercise,” he
said. Dr Matiang'i was
speaking in Makueni and Machakos counties after embarking on the issuance of
over 68,000 title deeds. The CS said Makueni
would receive 25,063 titles while Machakos would have 43,000, in line with the
government's commitment to beat the six million title deeds target, as directed
by President Uhuru Kenyatta last month. “Cumulatively,
President Kenyatta’s government has issued more than six million titles, a
record that beats the total deeds issued under the previous regimes combined
since independence,” Matiang'i stated. In the same light,
the CS cautioned the new title
deeds owners against taking advantage of the process to sell family land,
instead imploring them to secure resources to invest in income-generating
ventures. Consequently, the
cabinet secretary advised Ukambani residents to make sound political decisions
in the forthcoming elections in a bid to safeguard the development agenda in
the current regime. He said: “We need
transformative leaders who will carry over the good work. Don’t forget how
crucial these documents are and how long you have had to wait to acquire them.
Vote wisely.”
