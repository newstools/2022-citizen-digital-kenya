Two Chinese nationals were on Thursday
arrested at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) for attempting to
illegally export 5,703 kilograms of live crabs valued at Ksh.1.2 million. The crabs were conveniently packed in 282
boxes destined for export to China. The suspects were arrested following a
multi-agency operation between Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) Customs officers
based at the airport and detectives from the Directorate of Criminal
Investigations (DCI). KRA said the pair lacked proper fish
exporting licenses and could not explain the source of the crabs. “Upon questioning, a clearing agent from
Drenal Enterprises Limited informed the officers that the consignment
originated from Kilifi County and was booked for export to China by Weida
Investment Limited,” the taxman said in a statement. “The clearing agent presented permit
documents from the Kenya Fisheries Services (KFS) that were declared
non-authentic by KFS.”  The consignment is currently being held in
custody as KRA awaits further instructions from KFS.
