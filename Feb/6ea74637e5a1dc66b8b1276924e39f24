 The victim has since been identified as 41-year-old Victoria Nyambura Kamwaro.  Confirming the incident, Nairobi Deputy Police boss James Mugera cited that the woman's body did not have any visible physical injuries when her body was discovered in the vehicle, whose engine was still running at the time. According to Mugera, the car had stopped outside the restaurant’s premises for a long time prompting employees to check up on the vehicle only to find the deceased. The body of the deceased has since been moved to a local mortuary pending post-mortem. “An autopsy will tell what caused the death,” said Mugera. In an unrelated incident, Mtito Andei detectives are currently pursuing a gang of four carjackers alleged to have hijacked a truck driver along the Mombasa Highway before killing him and making away with coffee berries that he was transporting to Uganda from Mombasa. Reports indicate that the truck’s driver, John Mutie, was found restrained with a polythene paper by first responders who discovered his body. Eyewitnesses claim that the assailants casually fled after committing the crime. A special police force has since been formed to bring Mutie’s murderers to book.
