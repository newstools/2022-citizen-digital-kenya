   In a complaint before the tribunal, Gideon Ngewa Kenya and Kisilu Mutisya claimed that the Wiper Party’s flagbearer does not hold a degree recognised in Kenya.  The tribunal on Sunday threw out the complaint, saying that it lacked jurisdiction to hear and determine the subject raised by the two voters.  “The returning officer discharged his mandate in accordance with the law. The complaint lacks merit.This is our final orders; that the complaint be and is hereby dismissed with no orders,” the tribunal ruled.  Speaking after the relief, Wavinya Ndeti accused her opponents of filing the complaints in order to waste her time.  “I thank God, these people just wanted my time. I thank God I did not waste my time, I still continued campaigning on the ground. My father did not sell a cow to take a cow to school, I went to school, they should know that. Let them look for something else,” she said.  The ruling comes after the National Police Service commenced criminal investigations into the credentials she presented before IEBC.  The investigations were launched to prove the authenticity of Wavinya’s documents and those of his Nairobi counterpart Johnson Sakaja.  "Owing to the constitutional and legal mandate bestowed upon it, the NPS has commenced criminal investigations into the genuineness of the certificates presented for clearance to the IEBC by two political aspirants namely Hon Johnson Sakaja and Hon Wavinya Ndeti and determine if any offense has been committed," NPS said in a statement on Saturday.
