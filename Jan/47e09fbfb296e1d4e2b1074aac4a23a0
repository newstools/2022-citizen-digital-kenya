 Wiper Party leader Kalonzo Musyoka has dismissed social
media claims of his wife Pauline Musyoka passing on. In a statement on Sunday, the former Vice President’s press cautioned social media users against spreading false information regarding his ailing
wife. “The SKM Command Centre has been drawn to tweets circulating
concerning Mama Pauline Musyoka, the wife of the former Vice President Kalonzo
Musyoka,” read the statement. “This is FAKE NEWS. It is unfortunate we live in a time when
people spend their minutes trying to get the most clicks and not tell the
truth,” added the notice by Head of Communications Paloma Gatabaki. “It is sad that the spinners of hateful, horrific and fake
stories show no evidence of regret nor remorse for the damage they do. KOT let's
stop this incredibly distasteful behavior!” Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua had taken to social media to
break the news of her demise while condoling with Kalonzo's family. He has since retracted the statement and apologised.    Political leaders have also faulted the governor terming him ‘irresponsible’
for spreading false information. Kalonzo in an interview
with Citizen TV affirmed that his wife was stable in hospital. “Mama is stable and we thank God. We continue to pray for a
miracle,” Kalonzo said.
