The Ministry of Transport has temporarily
restricted commercial passenger vehicles or matatus from using the Nairobi
Expressway. This follows what the Ministry terms as
isolated safety incidents and road crashes witnessed on the expressway. “Since the Nairobi Expressway was opened to
the public, a number of traffic accidents and incidents involving commercial
passenger vehicles have occurred on the expressway," Transport Cabinet Secretary James Macharia said in a statement released on Wednesday. "They have necessitated an
investigation into the cause of these accidents and incidents, so that
appropriate safety interventions can be developed and ensure that commercial
passenger vehicles use the expressway safely.” Other measures taken to enhance safety on the
expressway include the installation of rumble strips to warn drivers to slowdown
as they approach various toll gates. Further, the Ministry says speed limits will
be enforced with speed cameras being installed on the expressway to enhance
adherence to the speed limits.  The Ministry also says traffic police will
now be stationed at various locations along the expressway including toll
stations. On Monday this week, an estimated 20 people were injured as a PSV mini-bus crashed into the Mlolongo toll station on the
Expressway, whilst hitting other vehicles at the exit point. This was the second accident at the toll
station in just over one week since private motorists crashed into the Mlolongo toll plaza.  One person died while an unknown number of
persons were injured in the June 25 incident.
