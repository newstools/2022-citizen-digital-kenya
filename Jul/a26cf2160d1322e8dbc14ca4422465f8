Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists
and Dentists Union (KMPDU) has
threatened to down their tools within seven days following delayed salaries for its staff. KMPDU Secretary General Dr Davji Atella on
Saturday said the strike will affect Murang'a, Kisii, Embu, Meru, Garissa and
Taita Taveta counties which had not paid their health workers. Dr Atella pointed out that despite numerous
consensus efforts between the union and the counties to have the workers’ pay
effected, county governors had not reached their end of the bargain. “Today we are putting them on warning and telling
all these counties that is; Murang'a, Kisii, Embu, Meru, Garissa and Taita
Taveta that in the next seven days they should not expect to see any doctors in those
facilities if they have not released salaries made for doctors and health care
workers,” Atella said. “It has come to our attention that many
counties have openly disregarded the payment of salaries to the doctors and
healthcare workers and some go even up to two months. It is not a threat, it is a warning and
doctors will be out of work if these salaries are not released immediately.” He added: “You cannot expect doctors and other
healthcare workers to be at the hospital treating patients when they themselves
are patients because they have not eaten due to no salaries.” With only 16 days to the general election, the union stresses the need for the incoming government to prioritise the
employment of more doctors. They say that most of the graduates in the
field have not been employed in a time when Kenyans are suffering due to a lack
of good healthcare.
