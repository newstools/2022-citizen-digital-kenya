 "Police have cleared the Int'l Terminal. SFO resumes normal operations," the airport said in a tweet on Saturday. The airport terminal was evacuated after San Francisco police said officers had received a bomb threat at the airport and found a suspicious package on investigation. The airport said it has resumed its AirTrain service and that the Bay Area Rapid Transit trains service would restart at 6:25 AM local time. The Associated Press reported that police had taken a man into custody following the investigation.
