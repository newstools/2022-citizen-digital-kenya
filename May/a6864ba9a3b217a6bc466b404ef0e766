Former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has
castigated Chief Justice Martha Koome and Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP)
Noordin Haji over what he terms as attempts to block his Mombasa governorship
bid on grounds that he was impeached from office. Koome and
Haji have in recent days been adamant that impeached governors and convicted
politicians are barred from holding public offices until their names and
verdicts are cleared and upended by the court. Speaking
to journalists at a hotel in Kilifi County on Saturday, Sonko underscored that
the Kenyan Constitution does not explicitly state that persons who have pending
court cases are not eligible to hold public offices. “For you
to vie the court has to set aside your impeachment but the Constitution says
that a person is not disqualified unless all possibilities of appeal or review
of the relevant sentence or decision has been exhausted,” he said. “Mine is
a decision; it is an impeachment. My abuse of office case is yet to be determined
by the Anti-Corruption Court in Nairobi.” The
flamboyant former governor went on to say that he will continue drumming up
support for his governorship bid despite Koome and Haji’s statements, citing
that he is invested in changing the fortunes of Mombasa residents. “I want
Koome to show us where it states in the Constitution that the sentence has to
be set aside first. I will continue campaigning. This thing is not about Sonko;
it is about bringing change to Mombasa,” he said. Sonko similarly
castigated a section of Coastal leaders who he said are publicly opposing his
bid and allegedly painting him in bad light in front of Mombasa residents. “When I
came here looking to change the livelihoods of Mombasa residents they started a
lot of propaganda. They started saying that I am a bad person and I am not a
native,” said Sonko. “What
non-native would make investments in Kilifi, Mombasa and Kwale and also employ
indigenous people from the Coast?”
