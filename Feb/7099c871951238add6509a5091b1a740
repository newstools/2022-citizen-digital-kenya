Rescue
operations are underway to free two people trapped on a ferry in Greece after
it caught fire, forcing the evacuation of hundreds of passengers and crew, the
Hellenic Coast Guard told CNN on Friday. The
Euroferry Olympia ship had 239 passengers and 51 crew members on board,
according to a Coast Guard statement. There
have been no immediate reports of deaths or severe injuries. The
ship was sailing under the Italian flag and was northeast of the island of
Ereikousa, close to Corfu, when the fire broke out. It
was en route from Igoumenitsa in northwestern Greece to Brindisi in southern
Italy. The
Coast Guard received a call about the fire on the ship around 4:30am local
time. According
to Reuters, most of the passengers boarded rescue vessels and were taken to the
neighboring island of Corfu. In
a press release Friday, the Hellenic Coast Guard said registration and
identification of the rescued passengers was underway. A
video published on the Greek news website Proto Thema showed the 600-foot
(183-meter) ferry engulfed in flames amid plumes of smoke. "May Day"
was blasting from the speakers. A
spokesperson for Grimaldi Lines, owner of the Euroferry Olympia, told Reuters
that while the cause of the fire was under investigation there were indications
it started within the ship's hold. Greek
public broadcaster ERT showed live pictures of boats carrying passengers
arriving at the port of Corfu. Speaking
on ERT, Corfu Hospital Director Leonidas Roubatis confirmed that three
passengers with light injuries had been brought in as a precaution, and that an
infant was also expected to be examined as a precaution.  In
2014, 10 people were killed when a car ferry carrying 466 passengers and
crew caught fire while sailing from Greece to Italy.
