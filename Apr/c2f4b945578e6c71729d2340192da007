Nairobi
governorship aspirant Agnes Kagure has reiterated that she is still in the race for Nairobi's governorship, despite reports suggesting that she has dropped her bid in favour of Polycarp Igathe. Taking
to Facebook, Kagure labelled the reports as hearsay while underscoring that she was
still in the race to occupy City Hall’s top seat, hinting that she was likely to take the independent route. “So
many rumors are being peddled by agents of doom, but they are just that, idle
rumors! We
began this journey years ago and officially launched it on January 7th. I have
no plans of abandoning the hundreds of thousands who believe in it halfway,” she
said. “Our
dream of a better Nairobi that is supportive of our talents and ambitions, a
city that is the envy of other cities, and a county that takes care of its
residents is firmly on course.” Former Equity Chief Commercial Officer (CCO) Igathe
on Thursday said that Kagure alongside Westlands MP Tim Wanyonyi and
businessman Richard Ngatia, had agreed to drop their bids and back him, following what he termed as successful consensus talks. Igathe's sentiments followed day-long deliberations at State
House, Nairobi, on Thursday on who among himself, and the three, would fly the
Azimio One Kenya flag in the city’s top race.  According to Igathe, Wanyonyi, Ngatia and Kagure verbally
agreed to back his bid.
