 Responding to claims from his political opponents that he failed the Jubilee government, Ruto stated that he should not be lectured on his performance while in office. During a roadside rally in Meru County on Sunday, he argued that the opposition party has no role in the current government and should not be associated with it. "And I want to tell hawa watu wa Azimio wawache kutuingilia na mambo ya track record ya serikali yetu. We will claim every credit ya ile kazi imefanywa na hii serikali kwa sababu sisi ndio tulimchagua Uhuru Kenyatta awe rais wa Kenya na kura zetu," posed DP Ruto. "...Watu wa azimio have no share in this government because they were nowhere when we were forming it," he added. Raila Odinga's Azimio la Umoja movement was also slammed by the second-in-command, who challenged them to stop using President Kenyatta as a political'shield' and face him ahead of the August polls. "Si mnajua tuna mashindano, na ningependa kuwaambia watu wa Azimio, wacheni kuzunguka Uhuru Kenyatta hamjawai kumpigia kura mnamzunguka ya nini...wacheni kujidanyanya tokeni nyuma yake mpambane na sisi, "said Ruto. He also promised residents in the area that his government would prioritize the Miraa business sector, claiming that he would bring in partners from neighboring countries to help expand the market. "Tumesema tunapanga mambo ya uchumi kama priority number one ili kilimo iweke pesa ya kutosha kwa mfuko ya mkulima ndo tufungua soko ya chai, soko ya miraa ili tuinue maisha ya wakulima wetu..." he posed. "Tayari tumefungua mazungmzo na serikali ya Somalia ili tufungue soko ya miraa yetu kwa sababu ni ya muhimu kwa wakulima wa sehemu hii wawe na soko ya mazao yao ya miraa." DP Ruto was flanked by leaders from the Kenya Kwanza outfit Musalia Mudavadi (ANC), Moses Wetangula (FORD-Kenya). Others present were Meru governor Mithika Linturi amongst other leaders.
