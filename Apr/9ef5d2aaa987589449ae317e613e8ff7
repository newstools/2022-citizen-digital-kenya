The government has
lifted the ban on scrap metals trade recently imposed by President Uhuru
Kenyatta to curb electricity equipment vandalism. Industrialization,
Trade and Enterprise Development Cabinet Secretary Betty Maina made the
announcement on Tuesday saying that the order takes effect beginning next
month. CS Maina noted that
the directive would be implemented gradually as the State seeks to allow only licensed traders to
take part in the scrap metal trade. "Government
will from 1st May 2022 lift ban on dealing, buying and selling of scrap metal
in the country. However only duly registered and licensed businesses will be
allowed to operate," CS Maina said. "All license
applicants will be vetted by the multi-Agency teams established in each
county." The government
foisted the ban on exports and dealings in scrap metal in January this year,
following high cases of vandalism in the country that had seen the country
experience power outages across the nation. In his move to ban
the scrap business, the Head of State said anyone found culpable would face
treason charges since the acts of vandalism ultimately translated to economic
sabotage that is a threat to the country's economy. “As of today, we will no longer allow and we have a
moratorium on the export or buying and selling of any scrap material until we
have put in place proper guidelines that will ensure that the material is not
coming from the hard material investments the people of Kenya have
made,” President Kenyatta said on January 20, 2022, during the graduation
parade of police cadet officers in Nyeri.
