 Mwaure during a roadside campaign in Murang’a on Thursday, said that Kenyans are highly taxed yet a big chunk of collected money is misappropriated through corruption. Reducing PAYE by 50 percent, Mwaure stated, will increase earning to the majority of Kenyans thus giving them high purchasing power. Mwaure insisted that the country needs emergency interventions to revive the economy and relieve the high cost of living. “This country is very rich, what has lacked is good shepherds who can protect the resources and provide better services to mwananchi. Forthcoming elections should be different where Kenyans can put right leaders into leadership and avoid recycling those who have brought our economy to its knees,” said Mwaure. The Agano party presidential candidate further alleged that Kenya has lost close to Ksh. 240 trillion since independence, saying if the money was well utilized, the country will be economically stable. “It’s a shame for a country which got independence in 1963, is still fighting with poverty, unemployment, and lack of quality health care. This is the time for Kenyans to vote in leaders who are not going to amass wealth but serve every Kenyan in the right manner,” he claimed. Confident that he is the best candidate for the presidency, he castigated his competitors,  saying they have served the government in various positions but have failed to provide better services to people. “My competitors are claiming how to bring change in this country yet they are still in government. Others have failed to advise the president well on better ways to lower cost of living,” posed Mwaure. Mwaure and his team will be extending his campaigns in counties within the central region for the next two days.
