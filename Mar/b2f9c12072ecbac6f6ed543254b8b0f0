 Education CS George Magoha announced on the last day of the 3-day exam period that saw 1.2 million candidates take the test. "In terms of marking, the marking process has already started on the first day and this is going to continue, and going by the progress we shall spend similar time like we did last year," said Magoha. Three cases of exam fraud were reported across the country
and the suspects arrested. CS Magoha on Wednesday said
that one of the cases involved an invigilator in Abrassa Academy-Marsabit County
who allegedly took photos of examination papers then distributed them. The other case, according to the CS, was witnessed in Turkana
County where a mobile phone was recovered containing examination answers. A headteacher from Naisambu Primary School in Trans Nzoia
county where another rigging claim was reported is also in police custody. Speaking at Kamukunji Sub-County container pick-up point in
Nairobi, Prof. Magoha said the headmaster of Naisambu Primary School in Kiminini area
was being investigated and if found guilty he would be arraigned. While calling upon examiners to abstain from any malpractice
and irregularities in the forthcoming KCSE exams, CS Magoha stressed that the
teachers already in custody would be a lesson to fellow colleagues. “As we go into next Monday, there are very high stakes
there, as we had said,  I had said, the
fate of those two teachers has been sealed. There are those who would want to
do the same, and you are welcome to do so! It is not worth it, don’t confuse
the children,” Magoha said.
