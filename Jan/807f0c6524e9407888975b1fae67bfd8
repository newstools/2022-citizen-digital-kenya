 The Supreme Court has issued fresh directives
that will be used in the hearing of a petition challenging the August 2021
decision by the Court of Appeal on the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI). Attorney General Paul Kihara Kariuki and the
Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) filed the petition in
September 2021 with the AG contesting eight findings by the Appellate court
that rescinded the attempt to alter the Constitution. IEBC on the other hand is challenging
findings pertaining its Constitutional mandate. According to the Supreme Court, only two
counsel per party shall appear and address the court in adherence to stipulated
COVID-19 prevention protocols. Appellants will similarly only be given 45
minutes to submit their cases. Individuals supporting the main respondent’s
case will only be allocated 15 minutes to make their case while appellants have
been issued 10 minutes to respond to counter the respondents. “The main Respondents, David Ndii, Jerotich
Seii, James Gondi, Wanjiru Gikonyo, Ikal Angelei, Thirdway Alliance, Miruri
Waweru and Angela Mwikali, including Phylister Wakesho, who were the main
Petitioners at the High Court, shall have 45 minutes each to highlight their
submissions,” stated court document. “Parties supporting the Appellants’ cases
shall have 15 minutes each to highlight their submissions.” “The allocated time shall be strictly
observed and when the timer goes off, the microphone will automatically be
switched off.” The Supreme Court similarly barred the Kenya
Human Rights Commission, Dr. Duncan Ojwang, Dr. John Osogo Ambani, Dr. Linda
Musumba and Dr. Jack Mwimali from making submissions since they are friends of
the court (Amicus Curiae).
