 Motorists raised their concerns Monday evening after a heavy downpour. Videos shared online showed a drainpipe loosely hanging from a carriageway, on a section along the Mombasa road, discharging rainwater on cars below. KeNHA acknowledged in a statement on Monday that the assigned contractor has not yet completed work on the drainage systems, but assured motorists that the problem will be resolved as soon as possible. "We regret for any inconveniences caused by this occurrence. The contractor is working to ensure that the drainage, among other features of the Nairobi Expressway, are finalized and fixed is a safe manner for all motorists," said KeNHA. The authority also stated that a team has been dispatched to work on redirecting drainage culverts as rain continues to pound different parts of the country. "In the meantime, the contractor has deployed extra work teams and equipment to focus on all outstanding works including the drainage system - targeting completion before the rains result into peak flows," read the statement. Motorists have been urged to exercise caution while plying the affected areas as they work on resolving the issue. "As this goes on, we urge motorists to exercise caution when driving through the storm water in the affected areas even as the works are ongoing to resolve the situation."
