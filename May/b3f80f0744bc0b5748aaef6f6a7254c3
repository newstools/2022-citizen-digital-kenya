Narc Kenya party leader Martha Karua was on
Tuesday accorded a warm welcome as she returned to her home county of Kirinyaga
a day after being named running mate by Azimio la Umoja One Kenya presidential
flagbearer Raila Odinga. The homecoming saw Karua thank Kirinyaga
residents and call on them to rally around the Raila-Karua presidential ticket. In a direct message to residents of Mt.
Kenya, Karua pledged to ensure that projects relating to the region are
prioritised in the Azimio coalition. “Kazi yangu ni kuja kupanda, kunyunyiza maji,
kupalilia…nitakuja kila siku mpaka siku ya mwisho, walio wengi tukuwe upande wa
Azimio ambayo kinara wake ni Raila Odinga akisaidiwa na Martha Karua,” she
said. Karua was accompanied by a host of Jubilee Party
leaders including Secretary General Jeremiah Kioni and irector of elections
Kanini Kega. “Leo tunataka tuambie wale kwamba sisi watu
wa mlima tumejipanga na tumesema mara hii ni mama,” said Kega. Karua added: “Kama Martha Karua na Peter Munya
wako ndani ya hiyo serikali, mnaona kama mambo ya mlima imeshikiliwa? Mkumbuke
Raila Odinga ni mtetezi wa haki za Wakenya, rekodi yake ni wazi.” Karua, who was hailed by her fellow leaders
as a reformist and a defender of human rights, warned Mt. Kenya voters against
making what she termed a wrong choice. “Tuelewe ya kwamba nchi yetu iko hatarini,
tusipochunga ni akina nani tutachagua, tunaweza poteza nchi yetu. Lakini bahati
tuko na tikiti ambayo inaweza aminika ya Azimio,” she stated. Kioni said: “Wale wafisadi tunajua pahali yao,
kwa hivo tunashukuru mmetokea kwa wingi, na tutakuja tena, na mhakikishe ya
kwamza mkienda nyumbani mmetutafutia kura ili tuweze kushinda wale wakora.” Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya on
his part stated: "Mama tunajua kazi yake… tunajua historia yake…yeye si
mfisadi, tunajua atanyorosha serikali na sheria mambo iwe sawasawa…na
wakishikana na Baba watabadilisha Kenya.”  The tour saw the leaders address roadside
rallies in among others Makutano, Kibingoti, Kagumo, Kerugoya, Mwea and
Kimunye.
