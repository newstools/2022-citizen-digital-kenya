 Military conscripts in Norway will now be required to return their undergarments, including underwear, bras and socks, upon graduation from the service for use by the next cohort of recruits. This is due to what the country’s military terms as a shortage of underwear supply contributed partly by the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the Norwegian state broadcaster NRK, the plan was originally meant to be voluntary but after prolonged supply chain delays during the pandemic, officials have now made it compulsory. “(Because of) a challenging stockpile situation, this move is necessary as it provides the Armed Forces with greater garment volumes available for new soldiers starting their initial service,” The Norwegian Defense Logistics Organization was quoted as saying on Monday by the AP. The agency also defended the move as good, provided the garments being reused undergo “proper checks and cleaning.” Military service is mandatory for both men and women in Norway and generally lasts between 12 and 19 months.  Previously, the conscripts were reportedly allowed to keep undergarments such as underwear, wool socks and T-shirts, as well as headgear and field boots after the service.
