Eight
officers attached to the department of roads at the Kericho County government have
been slapped with a total fine of Ksh.15.8 million after they were found guilty of irregularly awarding
a Ksh.5.6 million tender. The
eight; Lillian Chepkoech, John Kimutai Rotich, Japheth Kipngeno, Peter Koskei,
Joash Chirchir, Stanley Ruto, Charles Mabwai and Aaron Cheruiyot were arraigned
in court facing various charges in 2020. The
tender was for the construction of the Bae-Kapsimotwet-Kibara road in Belgut constituency. Lillian
Chepkoech, the roads inspector, is said to have been the director of Jawlink
Logistics Company which received Ksh.3.8 million for the construction of the
road. She
was fined Ksh.9.6 million, slightly double the amount she received, or serve a
three-year jail term if she defaults. Chepkoech's
co-accused and co-directors of Jawlink Logistics Company, John Kimutai Rotich
and Japheth Kipngeno, were fined Ksh.2 million each or serve 2 years in jail. Peter
Koskei, the former Roads Department Chief Officer, was fined Ksh.1.3 million or
serve eight years in jail. Koskei
was found guilty of failing to comply with the law relating to the procurement
by awarding the contract to Jawlink Logistics Limited. Joash
Chirchir (roads engineer), Stanley Ruto (roads inspector), Charles Mabwai (procurement
officer) and Aaron Njoroge (accountant) were fined Ksh.300,000 or serve two
years in prison. They
were charged under the Anti Corruption and Economic Crimes Act 2003, the
National Constructions Act 2011, and the Public Procurement and Assets Disposal
Act. The
sentencing was delivered by Kericho Ethics and Anti Corruption Court Chief
Magistrate Evans Makori. This
followed the judgment delivered by Magistrate Samuel Mokua, which established
that the prosecution led by State Counsel Lillian Muthoni had proved the case beyond
any reasonable doubt.  The
court granted the eight officers 14 days to appeal the judgment.
