Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe now
wants private hospital operators to reduce the cost of healthcare to serve the
needs of all Kenyans. Speaking in Mombasa on Friday during the
commemoration of World Cancer Day, CS Kagwe said the private sector ought to
review its charges to suit the government's mandate of affordable medical
healthcare to its citizens. “We held a meeting and decided that we would
continue with the old contract until we reached a consensus on the
harmonization of the contracts so that we avoid a situation where some hospitals
charge exorbitantly,” he said. “We don’t want a situation where we close
private hospitals. We are working as partners, but we have conditions. We must
give Kenyans quality and affordable healthcare.” During the meeting, Kagwe reiterated the
government's commitment to subsidizing the health sector through the Universal
Health Coverage (UHC) programme whose agenda was prioritizing access, cost and
quality of healthcare. “There are some things which will not happen
and must change. We will not go back to high prices for services. There is a
procedure being charged Ksh.6,000 in public hospitals with better
equipment than private hospitals who charge Ksh.60,000 for the same procedure,”
he stated. "Kenyans must not cough more money from
their pockets to pay for health when they are already paying monthly
contributions to the NHIF." The National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) on
Monday went into agreements with Kenya Private Hospitals Association after the
latter threatened to bar patients using NHIF card services. The two entities came to a consensus and
extended a prior contract for the next six months until July.  “When we have NHIF cards whatever we agree as
the government as the charge for a service is what will be paid by NHIF
irrespective of the hospitals. Patients should not add more money after the
services are rendered,” Kagwe explained.
