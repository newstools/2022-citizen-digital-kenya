Residents of
Ngaremara area of Isiolo County have accused government authorities of neglect and inaction after a woman in the area was raped and abducted
in broad daylight. Livestock including 25 cows and over 700 goats were
also stolen during the Saturday attack by the criminals from the neighbouring Samburu County. Tension is rife in
the area, with locals now accusing security agencies of inaction, as the
criminals operate along the border between Isiolo and Samburu
Counties. Isiolo County Commissioner Geoffrey Omonding however
refuted claims that a woman had been abducted on Sunday, arguing that he only heard
reports of a rape incident and livestock theft. He said police and the
National Government Administration Officers were already working to track down
the criminals and recover all the stolen animals. The residents are now threatening to conduct
demonstrations along the Isiolo – Moyale highway if the “illegal” herders are
not relocated back to their home counties and all the stolen animals recovered.
