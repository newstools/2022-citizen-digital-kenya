 Three men have been arrested in Nairobi on
suspicion of kidnapping a 23-year old man and holding him hostage while demanding a Ksh.300,000 ransom. The trio; Dickson Mwendwa (24), Robert Kioko (23)
and Philip Kilonzi (28), were nabbed by Githurai-based sleuths in a single room where
they were holding the victim. The Directorate of Criminal Investigation
(DCI) said the victim had traveled from Mwingi East to Githurai to visit a
couple that also hails from his rural area, only to arrive and find the woman of the house alone. “Within no time, the husband stormed in
accompanied by three other men, who landed on the young man with blows and
kicks on allegation of having a romantic affair with the wife,” DCI stated. The suspects are then said to have frisked
the victim and taken Ksh.5,000 before hurling him into an empty room. “The victim was forced to contact his family
members to raise the Ksh.300,000 ransom, threatening dire consequences if they
failed to comply,” said the DCI. Acting on information from the victim’s
father, detectives trailed the suspects and netted them. They also found the abducted man in a single
room having been stripped naked, with injuries on the face. "The victim
who had been stripped naked and injured on the face was rescued to safety,"
the DCI noted. The suspects are behind bars awaiting
arraignment as investigations continue.
