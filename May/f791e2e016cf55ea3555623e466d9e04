President
Uhuru Kenyatta has sent a message of condolence to Mama Mukami Kimathi and the
entire family of freedom hero Dedan Kimathi following the death of their
grandson Teddy Mukaria Githinji. In his
message of comfort and encouragement, President Kenyatta eulogised the late
Teddy Mukaria as a focused and productive person of great promise. “My
family and I share in the pain of your shattering loss. At barely 25 years,
Teddy was a young, focused and productive person of great promise. He was
equally a talented young man with a passion for environmental conservation. “His
death is a big blow to Dedan Kimathi's family and I pray that God gives them
comfort during this difficult period," the President said.  The Head
of State said the late Teddy will fondly be remembered as an outstanding and
gifted role model to the youth.
