Two children were burnt beyond recognition on
Saturday after a gas cylinder exploded at their home in Ligodho, Homa Bay
County. Reports
say that the minors, aged three and five, were in their grandmother's house
when the incident occurred. The
victims' grandmother managed to escape the inferno but was unable to save the
two minors or any of her property.  The
bodies of the minors have since been moved to a local mortuary as
investigations into the incident continue.
