A Kajiado Court has sentenced a headteacher to life imprisonment for
defiling a 10-year-old girl from his neighbourhood. According to a report from the Director of Public Prosecution, the
prosecution led by Counsel, Gladys Chepngeno proved the case beyond reasonable
doubt. During the ruling of the case which has been in court for
eight years, the headteacher was found guilty of charges levelled against him
and slapped with life imprisonment. While reassuring the public of his commitment to clear the backlog of cases in the judicial system, the DPP vowed to work closely with
all stakeholders.  “ODPP is working closely with criminal justice actors to
ensure that they clear backlog of cases in the system,” read the statement.
