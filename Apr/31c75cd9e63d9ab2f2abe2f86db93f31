 The price of petrol, diesel and kerosene is set to rise by Ksh.9.90 across the board. The Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA) has attributed the rise in fuel costs to increased landed costs of all three products with the landed cost of petrol, diesel and kerosene increasing by 20.5%, 24.7% and 11.8% respectively. The cost of petrol in the Capital Nairobi is expected to hit Ksh.144.62 from Friday midnight while diesel and kerosene costs will settle at Ksh.125.50 and Ksh.113.44 respectively per litre. The fuel subsidy has nevertheless spared Kenyans from greater fuel costs without which petrol costs were expected to hit Ksh.173.70. The subsidy has prevented a further Ksh.29.08 rise in the cost of petrol, Ksh.40.24 for diesel and Ksh.46.55 for kerosene. The increase in fuel prices comes amid a fuel shortage crisis that plagued Kenya in the last two weeks resulting in fuel shortages not witnessed in the country for years following a standoff between the government and Oil Marketing Companies. Acting Petroleum CS Monica Juma has however assured that normal fuel supply across the country will be stabilised within the next 72 hours.
