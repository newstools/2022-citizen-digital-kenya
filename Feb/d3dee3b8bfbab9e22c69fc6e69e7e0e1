 The body of the pupil was found dangling from the roof of his parents’ sitting room after he hung himself using his belt. According to Siaya Sub-County Police Commander Bernard Mwangagi, the matter was reported by the area chief before the police rushed to the scene. The Police boss stated that the Siaya township primary school pupil is said to have looked disturbed and had even tried to take his life the previous day but was prevented. The boy’s body has since been removed to the Siaya County referral hospital mortuary to await a postmortem as investigations continue into the matter. Mwangangi has, meanwhile, advised parents and guardians to find ways of solving their children’s problems whenever they notice a change in behavior to prevent such an untimely loss of lives.
