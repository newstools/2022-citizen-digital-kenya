Garissa traders operating at the open-air
market popularly known as Suq Muqdi are counting losses running into millions
of shillings following a fire incident that razed down the entire market on
Thursday. The market - which has a capacity of more
than 5,000 mostly small scale traders dealing in clothing, groceries,
electronics, eatery, butcheries - was reduced to ashes in the inferno. Although the cause of the fire could not be
immediately established, Garissa OCPD James Ng’etich said investigations
are underway. "We have started right away and we are
trying to interrogate all the teams; watchmen at night, market management and
we are also trying to find out from Kenya Power if there is an issue of
electricity and from the fire brigade; what actually happened," Nge'tich
said. The police boss said detectives from the
Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) had also visited the scene and
launched a probe into the incident. "We are investigating and our DCI is on
the ground with the whole team and to establish what really is the cause,” he
stated. Ng'etich further implored the public to
report to the police any leads regarding the incident.  "Mtu yeyote ambaye ana habari kuhusu
kisa cha moto hii ningependa apate kutusaidia ndio mkono wa sheria ipate
kuchukua mkondo wake," he added.
