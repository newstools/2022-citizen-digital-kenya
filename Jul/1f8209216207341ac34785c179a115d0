Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has accused Kiambu
politicians with ties to the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) of ganging up against his governorship bid. In a Facebook post on Thursday, the Chama Cha Kazi
(CCK) Kiambu governor candidate, accused his so-called- detractors of suspending their campaigns to drum up support for Kiambu Senator
Kimani Wamatangi who is also eyeing the County's top seat at the August polls, According to Kuria, while soliciting support for
Wamatangi, the UDA politicians have allegedly been actively dissuading
residents from supporting his bid despite the fact that CCK is  part of the Deputy President William Ruto-led Kenya Kwanza Alliance. He went on to insinuate that the increased attention
from UDA should instead be directed to the Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Alliance which
on paper is the biggest obstacle to many Kenya Kwanza politicians clinching
elective seats at the August polls. "This game is becoming
interesting. The entire UDA brigade in Kiambu County has suspended their
campaigns in 12 Constituencies to shore up Wamatangi's faltering campaign and
fight one Moses Kuria not Azimio. Popcorn please," said Kuria in
the post. This is not
the first time that Kuria has been critical of Kiambu politicians affiliated
with UDA. In June, Kuria accused the
UDA party leadership of sidelining aspirants seeking the Kiambu Governor’s seat
on relatively smaller parties within the larger Kenya Kwanza alliance. According to Kuria, MCAs and
MPs who have been perceived as leaning towards these said parties have been
subjected to constant threats over their stands. His sentiments followed a
public clash between Kiambu County Governor aspirants Kimani Wamatangi (UDA)
and William Kabogo (Tujibebe Wakenya party) during a Kenya Kwanza campaign rally led by DP Ruto's running mate Rigathi Gachagua in Kiambu.
