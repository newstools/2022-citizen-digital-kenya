 The embattled lawyer has been in Canada since his 2018 deportation over the mock following the mock swearing-in of ODM leader Raila Odinga as the ‘people’s president’. According to the DP, Migiuna is a Kenyan and should be dealt with in accordance with the law if what he did was illegal, instead of being exiled. “We will bring back Miguna Miguna in the country within the shortest time possible when I become President,” said DP Ruto in an interview with VOA on Saturday. He added: “This is because he's Kenyan and even if he has committed a crime, our country has laws in place. I don't see any need for having refugees from other countries while our very own is a refugee in another country." Ruto’s sentiments come two weeks after Migiuna declared his intention to run for the Nairobi governor’s seat in the forthcoming August General Elections. The firebrand lawyer believes that he is still entitled the right as a Kenyan citizen to vie for the seat. Miguna, who during the 2017 elections contested for the same seat but lost to former Governor Mike Sonko, says that he has not yet shelved his ambition to serve the city’s residents. “I intend to run for the Nairobi gubernatorial seat. I am a registered voter and I can run for office,” Miguna said on February 23. He disclosed that he would not be running independently as during his last race but will soon be revealing the political party he will run under. “I will be running on a party yet to be declared; that is where it is. Wait for the announcement, if I change my mind I will let you know,” he said then.
