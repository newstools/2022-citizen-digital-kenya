Nairobi County gubernatorial aspirant Polycarp Igathe and his running mate Philip
Kaloki have been given a nod by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission
(IEBC) to run for the seat.  “I can confirm to the millions of supporters in the county, that the IEBC has accepted the Igathe-Kaloki ticket and we have asked them to get ready to count for over 1.5 million votes on August 9,” said Igathe.  “What we expect from now is to hit the streets, the roads, the doors… We will be in each and every single ward in Nairobi conversing for the vote.” On his part, Prof Kaloki exuded confidence that the pair's competence and vast experience in leadership would propel the county to huge milestones and ensure major transformations. “We are going to bring a lot of experience, development, a lot of projects and we have a lot of support to make sure we reform the city. This city is not going to be the same, we are going to do things right for the benefit of our people,” Kaloki said. Igathe underscored importance of peaceful elections saying their candidacy would promote peace and unity during campaigns and after campaigns. “We would like to ask all citizens mpige kura kwa amani; siasa si uhasama, siasa ni sera. Siasa ni kurai wananchi. We are going to be bringing a lot of peace as we do it. The Azimio
allied leaders similarly promised to help the youth who are the majority in setting up businesses and cleaning up the streets of the city.
