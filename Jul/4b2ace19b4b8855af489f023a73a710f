 Mr. Kiprop, who is eyeing the county’s top seat on an independent ticket, claims his bid in the 2017 General Election was frustrated by unnamed competitors who reportedly hired crowds to disrupt his campaigns. “In 2017, my vehicles were pelted with stones while I was campaigning and I managed to escape unhurt,” Buzeki told hosts Waihiga Mwaura and Mashirima Kapombe when he appeared on Sunday’s Debate 2022 program on Citizen TV. “But I have a boy who was admitted in hospital and his eye permanently injured, so I will speak out about hostility without fear.” According to the businessman, this made him be extra vigilant this time round, opting to forego police security for his own intelligence officers whom he says he has positioned strategically across Uasin Gishu. “I have taken the personal initiative to hire private investigators and I have positioned them everywhere. I will ensure there is peace through my own means. If I find groups of people holding fishy meetings I'll be giving that information as soon as possible to the police,” said Buzeki. He added: “They need help, they cannot do all this alone. They need the people to give them some intel in order to stay proactive against these rogue people who don't want others to vote peacefully.” Buzeki is in the race to succeed Governor Jackson Mandago alongside Jonathan Bii, aka Koti Moja, of the United Democratic Alliance and William Kirwa of UDM.
