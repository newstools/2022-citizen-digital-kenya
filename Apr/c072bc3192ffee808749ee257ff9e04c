Political
parties willing to join the Kenya Kwanza alliance now have until May 9, 2022 to
do so before the window is closed. This is according to Kenya Kwanza co-principal
and ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi, who spoke on Saturday at a Karen hotel
when the coalition signed an agreement with National Assembly Speaker Justin
Muturi’s Democratic Party (DP). Mudavadi also sought to clarify that Kenya
Kwanza is not a coalition party but but rather a coalition of parties, hence
stating that the Office of the Registrar of Political Parties’ (ORPP) April 9
deadline does not apply to it. He said the coalition, which is also
composed of DP William Ruto’s UDA and Moses Wetangula’s Ford-Kenya parties, will
be ushering other parties into their fold until May 9 after which they will
launch their final document. “Kenya Kwanza will not be submitting
anything today and we will be going in as a coalition of parties and not a
coalition party...that is because we want to work with other parties and give
them the opportunity to be identified, to have their respect,” he said. “The deadline for lodging our document is
actually on the 9th of May.” The former deputy prime minister said the
move by Kenya Kwanza to be a coalition of parties rather than a coalition party
was so as to accord other parties their position in the coalition. He similarly hit out at their political
rivals whom he claimed were denying individual parties a voice by undermining
them.  “What we have seen from our competitors is
that they are trying to force an engagement that does not allow for the
recognition of individual political parties but we in Kenya Kwanza are saying
there is room for that recognition,” said Mudavadi.
