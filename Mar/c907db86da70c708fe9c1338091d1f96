At least seven people died as Tropical
Cyclone Gombe made early morning landfall in Mozambique on Friday packing wind
speeds exceeding 200 km/h (125 mph) that pummeled north and central areas of
the country, President Filipe Nyusi said. The southern African country has been
struggling to recover from a series of devastating cyclones that have killed
scores of people and displaced thousands. Nyusi, speaking to reporters during a visit
to South Africa, said: "I have briefed President Ramaphosa on the Gombe
tropical storm affecting Mozambique since 2 a.m. today. Seven people were
killed across Nampula province due to fallen houses and other infrastructure
(collapsing)." He said the storm's initial damage was in
Nampula in Mozambique's northeast. The World Meteorological Organisation said
Gombe made landfall as an intense category-3 cyclone, predicting
"devastating winds, rainfall and storm surge". "Winds have weakened but the heavy rains
bring a threat of flooding in Mozambique and southern Malawi for several
days," the WMO said in a tweet. According to the Saffir-Simpson hurricane
wind scale, category 3 denotes cyclones with one-minute, maximum sustained
winds of between 178 km/h and 207 km/h. State broadcaster TVM and private channels
aired footage showing fallen trees and poorly built clay adobe homes with roofs
ripped off by fierce winds. Heavy rains were also causing flooding in low-lying
areas, authorities said. Tropical Storm Ana killed at least 88 people
across southern and eastern Africa in January, the most recent severe storm to
hit a southern African region where millions of impoverished people are facing
volatile weather conditions blamed on rising temperatures and climate
change.
