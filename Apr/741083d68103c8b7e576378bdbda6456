Thika Town Member of Parliament Patrick
Wainaina, popularly known as Jungle, now says he will pursue the Kiambu
governor’s seat as an independent candidate. This follows his defeat in Thursday’s nominations
that saw the county Senator Kimani Wamatangi clinch the United Democratic
Alliance (UDA) party ticket for the gubernatorial race ahead of the August
polls. Jungle dismissed Wamatangi’s victory claiming
the process was marred with irregularities and that the winner was already
pre-determined by the Deputy President William Ruto-led party. “There was voter bribery which was very
widespread; election officials elected were instructed by the party to favour
one side,” he said. The MP further asserted that the ballot
papers had been incorrectly marked since his name, ‘Jungle’ was omitted, something
he says was a plot to rig votes by ensuring voters did not recognize him. “My name ‘Jungle’ is official and recognized
in my ID. When I went to register myself at the party, my name was included as
Patrick Wainaina Jungle. Now in the ballot papers, they only included only two
names, Jungle was not included,” he noted. On the same issue, he alleged that the image
used against his name was visually unclear and did not resemble him. “Ile picha walitumia, waliweka ilikuwa ni
picha ingine haikai kama mimi, na hiyo ni mpango ili wale wananipigia kura
wasije kunitambua, na hiyo ni rigging,” he said.  The legislator will now battle it out with
Senator Wamatangi, Chama Cha Kazi (CCK) party leader Moses Kuria, Tujibebe
party chief and ex-Kiambu governor William Kabogo as well as incumbent county
boss James Nyoro for the seat.
