 38-year-old Thomas Anasi, a former line technician at the electricity distribution company, and Joseph Kagwi, 36, a businessman based in Thika, allegedly vandalized part of the Kenya Power & Lighting Company (KPLC) electricity infrastructure. Anasi was arrested in Kayole while Kagwi was seized in Thika. A statement from the Directorate of Criminal Investigation (DCI) issued on Wednesday said that the two were arrested after electricity cables and other materials intended for connecting electricity to local residences in the area went missing. "Before their disappearance, the materials worth millions of shillings were at a site in Kushe area, where the government was in the process of connecting locals to the national grid," said DCI. DCI added that the theft was carried out by a syndicate of technicians and engineers at the electricity connection sites, who aided them in executing the theft. "However, the duo who are well connected to insiders at KPLC, masterminded the disappearance of wires, rods, conductors, and other equipment meant for the project, on January 28, 2022," stated DCI. The team is said to have deployed a crane truck that ferried the materials to a yard in Nairobi, which has since been impounded at the Kayole police station. Detectives also recovered stolen cables and metal rods.
