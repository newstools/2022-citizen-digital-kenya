 Azimio La Umoja leader Raila Odinga’s presidential
running mate Martha Karua wowed supporters in Eldoret town, Uasin Gishu County,
on Sunday when she abandoned her vehicle to seek votes on foot. In her fist tour of the county ahead
of the August General Election, the deputy presidential hopeful is said to have
walked over three kilometers interacting with residents on the streets, a
departure from the usual style of addressing congregants from atop an SUV. The Azimio running mate had earlier
attended a church service in a local church and  was accompanied by nominated MP Maina
Kamanda among other Azimio-allied leaders. Ms. Karua addressed residents at
the Eldoret main market on her way to a rally at Huruma grounds. At the service at the Ayub Kinyua
PCEA church, Karua called for political tolerance as campaigns heat up ahead of
the August polls, urging the congregation to lend leaders from all persuasions
their ears and vote for whoever they like in the end. She said that Kenyans needed to
be mindful of life after August 9 and avoid any actions which might compromise
the country’s peace after the polls. Similarly, Karua urged religious leaders to pray for the country and lead as
an example during the electioneering period. "The church should also help Kenyans to understand the difference
between bad and good even as we prepare to elect leaders for our nation,"
she said. Uasin Gishu is considered United Democratic Alliance (UDA)’s stronghold for
being Deputy President William Ruto's home county but Azimo enjoys support,
mostly within Eldoret.
