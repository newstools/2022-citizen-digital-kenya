The
Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) has now summoned Soy MP Caleb
Kositany, his Kapseret counterpart Oscar Sudi and Uasin Gishu County Assembly
Speaker David Kiplagat over chaos witnessed at the Friday burial of late
businessman Jackson Kibor.  According to the DCI, the chaos that was unleashed during the burial at Kabenes village led to the damage of Azimio la Umoja One Kenya coalition party presidential flagbearer Raila Odinga’s helicopter. The
DCI, in a statement released on Saturday evening, said preliminary
investigations had revealed that the three leaders allegedly organized and
coordinated the violence that was witnessed. MPs
Kositany, Sudi, and Speaker Kiplagat are hence expected to appear before the Rift
Valley DCI boss on Sunday in the morning. “At
the closure of the ceremony, chaos erupted and stones including other
projectiles were hurled at the former Prime Minister by incited youth,  maliciously damaging his helicopter’s
windscreen,” read the statement.  “In
view of the foregoing, the two legislators and County Assembly Speaker have
pursuant to Section 52 of the National Police Service Act 2011, been summoned
to appear in person before the Rift Valley DCI Regional Coordinator on April 3,
2022, at 9am, for further investigations into their involvement in the
incident.”
