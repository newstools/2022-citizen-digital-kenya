The Independent Policing Oversight Authority
(IPOA) is investigating the fatal shooting of two suspected gangsters in
Pangani, Nairobi. According to IPOA Chairperson Anne Makori, a
rapid response team has been formed to investigate the incident in line with
the authority’s mandate to probe deaths and injuries caused by police officers
in the line of duty. “The authority took up the matter on strength
of preliminary information, including but not limited to video clips depicting
a crime scene which captures what appears to be a shooting and presence of
police officers,” the IPOA boss said in a statement. While underscoring that IPOA remains
impartial and fair in all its investigations, Ms. Makori likewise stated that
the authority will not hesitate to make recommendations, including but not
limited to prosecution, if the findings of their investigations point to foul
play on the police’s part. The two alleged gangsters were gunned
down along Dr. Griffins Road after a purported fierce gunfight with
Starehe-based Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) detectives.  According to police, the two were linked to a
number of violent crimes in and around Eastleigh area.
