Long-time politician Cyrus Jirongo has tried to absolve
himself from the 1992/93 economic collapse. Jirongo distanced the KANU youth
wing, infamously referred to as YK 92, that he led from the economic nosedive.
He instead blamed the Goldberg Scandal for fleecing the country. Jirongo
sensationally claimed that two politicians and another person of Asian origin
were responsible for the disaster.
