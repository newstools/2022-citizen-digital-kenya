Interior Cabinet Secretary Dr. Fred Matiang’i has urged politicians to stop attacking National Government Officers during public rallies. According to the CS, such attacks are unwarranted and they risk demoralising and dehumanising innocent public servants who lack the opportunity to defend themselves. Referring to last weekend’s political rally in Eldoret, Matiang'i took issue with some politicians allied to the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) who attacked Uasin Gishu County Commissioner, Stephen Kihara. During the rally hosted at the Eldoret Sports Club, politicians led by Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua accused Kihara of allegedly hosting secret meetings to wage ethnic divisions in the cosmopolitan County. “Bwana Kihara is one of our most experienced public servants who has risen through the ranks. Uasin Gishu is not even his first station; he has worked everywhere. Let us stop profiling public servants. As the supervising minister for County commissioners I have no report on any misconduct on the part from Kihara,” the CS said in Nyamira on Friday. The CS, who alongside Interior PS Karanja Kibicho,  has been on the receiving end of attacks by UDA leaders similarly challenged politicians to exploit public forums to pitch for their manifestos and that of their parties and preferred candidates instead of waging personalised wars on public officers. “Kenya is better than this. Some of these things we are seeing are lowering the standards of leadership in the country. Hatujaona viongozi wa kiburi na matusi namna hii. Eti wewe sasa kazi yako ukienda kuongea ni lazima useme ati Matiang’i ama Kibicho,” the Interior CS said. “Matiang’i na Kibicho ndio manifesto yako?” He consequently advised political leaders with genuine grievances against public officers to exploit available formal channels to raise them.
