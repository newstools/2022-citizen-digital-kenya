Police in Bungoma County have recovered two
metal boxes which were used by three gangsters to ferry Ksh.25 million stolen
at the Ushirika Cooperative Bank in Kimilili. Two robbers have since been identified after
they were captured on CCTV carrying AK47 guns and the two metal boxes
containing the cash. Police are yet to arrest the suspects who
left three people, among them two police officers, nursing gunshot wounds. In the CCTV footage, one robber is seen
running while carrying three AK-47 rifles. He turns back after realizing that
his partner is stuck with the two metal boxes containing the money. The robber is seen handing over one of the
guns to his partner and together they leave with each one of them carrying one
box. The boxes were later recovered in Bumula, 50
kilometres away from the scene of crime but without the cash. The two robbers caught on the CCTV and their
accomplice who was the driver of a getaway car are still at large. Sources have intimated to Citizen TV that a
team of detectives from the DCI headquarters have been dispatched to help their
Bungoma counterparts in tracking the suspects and recovering the stolen money.  Two police officers and the bank manager who
sustained gunshot wounds during the robbery incident are still admitted at the
Moi Referral Hospital and St. Luke Hospital in Eldoret.
