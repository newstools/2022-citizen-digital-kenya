 A
76-year-old retired teacher was on Thursday morning found dead at a lodging in
Molo, Nakuru County after allegedly going to bed with an unknown woman who has
since gone missing. Eyewitness
reports say that the deceased was spotted at Miti Mirefu, a local pub, on
Wednesday night where he is alleged to have been indulging in alcohol before proceeding
to Salama Boarding and Lodging, at around 10 pm, where he had booked a room. He
was later joined by the unidentified woman 30 minutes later. The
body of the deceased was discovered the following morning by one of the lodge’s
attendants who was cleaning the rooms. “A
cleaner at the lodges discovered the man’s lifeless body, after she noticed
that the door to his room had not been locked. She immediately alerted the
manager Bernard Kiarie, who informed our detectives based in Molo,” the
Directorate of Criminal Investigations said in a statement. Crime
detectives have since visited the scene and are following crucial leads that
may lead to the apprehension of the suspect. The
victim’s body has since been moved to a local mortuary. The
incident mirrors one recorded in Mlolongo, Machakos County on Wednesday where the
body of a 26-year-old man was discovered at Miathathia guest house.  The
DCI has since urged lodging owners to take down the full details of all persons using their facilities as recorded in their national identification
cards.
