 Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Noordin Haji now wants Kitutu Chache MP Richard Onyonka probed over incitement claims. In a letter to Inspector General Hillary Mutyambai on Monday, DPP Haji directed that investigations immediately begin surrounding a video where Onyonka is captured uttering alleged unlawful remarks. “Reference is made to a video clip circulating on social media platforms in which Hon. Richard Onyonka, MP for Kitutu Mache Constituency is addressing a gathering in Kisii County,” stated Haji in the letter. “The alleged remarks captured in the video clip may be contrary to Article 33(2) of the Constitution of Kenya, to, which provides inter alia that "The right to freedom of expression does not extend to— (a) propaganda for war; (b) incitement to violence; (c) hate speech; or (d) advocacy of hatred" and section 62(1) of the National Cohesion and Integration Act, No. 12 of 2008,” he added. In the video circulating on social media, Onyonka is seen addressing a crowd in what appears to be a response to utterances made at Deputy President William Ruto’s rally in Eldoret on Saturday. “... Ningependa kumwambia ndugu yangu William Ruto; usijaribu kuharibu Kenya kama nchi kwa sababu unataka uongozi kwa kifua. “Mkisii anajitafutia, mkisii amejipanga Kenya mzima. Ukigusa mkisii tutakutafuta hata wewe mahali utakuwa… wakati huu ukigusa mkisii hata mmoja hutaweza kuja hapa Kisii,” says Onyonka. Haji instructed IG Mutyambai to submit his findings within seven days. “Pursuant to Article iv (4) of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010, you are hereby directed to undertake investigations into the aforementioned matter and submit the investigation file within seven (7) days of the date hereof,” he stated.
