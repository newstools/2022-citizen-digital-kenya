 Deputy President William Ruto has continued
to rally supporters behind his bottom-up economic model campaigns as he seeks
to have his stab at the forthcoming presidential elections. The deputy president, speaking during a tour of
Kajiado County on Thursday, called on area residents to buy into his hustler
narrative. Ruto emphasized that his agenda had the
backing of international leaders and was well-proven as the ultimate solution
to the problems affecting the country. “Nyinyi
mnakubaliana na bwana kitendawili ati tubadilishe katiba tuongeze mamlaka ya rais
na tuongeze vyeo ama mnataka tubadilishe uchumi kwanza?” He posed. “Even the President of USA Joe Biden accepts
that the trickle-down economic model has failed, that is why even America today
is adopting to the bottom-up economic model.” DP Ruto sought to assert that his proposed
economic model would ensure that all Kenyans equitably benefit, with a focus on
those in the lower social class. “Nyinyi
ambao ni wasomi mnajua tumekuwa tukiendeleza model ya uchumi ambayo inaitwa
trickle down, yaani ambapo watu wachache wanafaidika ati wakishatajirika wakuje
wainvest ndio hao wengine wakuje wafaidike. Tumengojea miaka hamsini
haijafanyika,” Ruto stated. At the same time, he faulted his political
rival Raila Odinga’s Azimio la Umoja agenda saying it was only for the wealthy
in the country and will lead to tribal division rather than uniting Kenyans. "Kwa
sababu hawa watu tumewashinda na pande zote, tumewashinda na mpango,
tumewashinda na akili, tuko na chama hawana, tuko na sera hawana, tuko na
candidate hawajielewi, tuko na UDA wako na ingine inajiita kuzimia,” said
the DP. "Mimi
nataka kuwaambia msikubali watugawanye. Kwa sababu agenda yao ni kutugawanya
katika vyama vya ukabila, sehemu na vijiji." Ruto consequently downplayed his competitors
alleging that they had nothing to show for the region’s projects while he himself
had a well-laid track record of developments. “Si
mnajua mimi ninashindana na kitendawili…na si alikuwa Prime Minister na mimi
nimekuwa Vice President na kila mmoja amepata nafasi ya uongozi? Hii si
mashindano ya urembo,  ni mashindano ya kazi. Kazi ya bwana kitendawili
iko wapi? Si kazi yangu inaonekana huku?” He posed to the crowd.
