Murang’a gubernatorial aspirant Dr. Irungu Kang’ata has
dropped his proposed running mate, Winfred Mwangi, 53, for 29-year-old Stephen
Mburu Munania in a last-minute move to meet the clearance deadline. Mr. Kang’ata had on Sunday been denied clearance by the
Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission because Dr. Mwangi, a don at
the University of Nairobi, failed to resign by the February 9 deadline. On Monday, Dr. Kang'ata and Dr. Mwangi announced that the
resignation issue had been resolved and that he had finally been cleared to run
under the UDA party. However, late into the evening, Kang'ata took to Facebook to
announce a new running mate in a post labeled as “a joint press statement” with
Dr Mwangi. “Taking into account this might have been a trap for
prolonged litigation that detracts us from campaigning ,we mutually agreed to
replace DG,” the statement read in part,”UDA Muranga DG designate now  is Stephen Mburu Munania.” Both Dr. Mwangi and Mr. Munania hail from Gatanga
Sub-county. Mr. Munania is a degree holder in International Diplomacy
and has previously worked as an Assistant County Commissioner Cadet in Kenol. He lost in Kariara ward UDA primaries to Jeremy Gichobe
Mbatia. "UDA picked him to represent the marginalised youth and
brings public administration experience into county management," they
added. Dr. Kang’ata however noted that Dr. Mwangi will remain “part
and parcel of the UDA Muranga chapter.” “She will continue to offer her services as an expert in
land matters. She will head our UDA campaigns,” the statement added. “We forgive those that breached her privacy.We hope to
transit with her into county government leadership come August 2022.”
