 The 42 students, their principal, Chemistry teacher, two laboratory technicians, the supervisor and five invigilators were taken to the Siaya police station to record a statement after it was realized they had a leakage of the Chemistry practical paper that was being done on Friday. According to Alego/Usonga Sub-County Police Commander Benedict Mwangangi, 20 candidates were found in possession of four mobile phones which had some leakage of the Chemistry paper that they were going to sit for. The police boss says that upon scrutiny of the phones, it was discovered that they also had a leakage of the Kiswahili paper which was done on Thursday. Mr Mwangangi stated that the phone had a WhatsApp group with 42 students from that school as members, a reason that forced them to look for the other 20 learners to also accompany the first 22 to record a statement at the police station. Siaya Sub-county Deputy County Commissioner Enock Nyarango said even though the key suspect in the syndicate is still at large, they picked the nine others among them the school principal and Chemistry teacher to also record a statement with the police.  Nyarango stated that the students will spend the weekend in police custody as investigations into the matter continue.
