  “I want to tell the DP Ruto and Raila Odinga, I'm not insulting them but we don’t have a monopoly in this country. I saw Ruto for the first time saying that I was ‘parachuted in’…don’t threaten me, continue threatening your other rivals, not me,” he said during his campaigns in Meru on Friday. Ruto, whose Kenya Kwanza team termed the Roots party leader as a government project during an interview on Thursday said, Wajackoyah's manifesto launch was a ploy to divert attention from his own. "On that day of the manifesto launch, a fellow (Wajackoyah) was parachuted so that we share the screen, which again speaks to the same narrative of a biased media," Ruto told KTN News on Thursday night. Meanwhile, Wajackoyah said that Directorate of Criminal Investigation (DCI) George
Kinoti will be part of his Cabinet if he wins the August polls. Wajackoyah lauded the DCI boss, saying that despite his dedication to serving the country, he was
unlawfully being criticised by politicians and he would appoint him as a
replacement for Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i if he ascends to power. He similarly identified lawyer Muthomi
Thiankolu from the same region to assume the
position of the Attorney General in his government. “I am going to request him, to see if he accepts to be the new
Attorney General from August,” he said.
