 Mrs.Obado on Sunday announced that she will be on the ballot come August 9 as an independent candidate. She said she wants to complete some of the projects like Kuku ni Pesa which he began several years back but collapsed, adding that she has the capacity to lead the people of Migori county. “Now I know if I am given that opportunity I will finish it well, alongside some other projects on empowering the girls,” she said. “I just want the people of Migori to look at me as Hellen and trust me with their vote,” added Mrs. Obado, who has also previously been urging voters not to judge her by her husband's 'baggage'. The Migori governor has been facing corruption and murder charges in court and his wife has avoided his People Democratic Party (PDP) in her bid, citing “personal reasons”. Meanwhile, several contenders are out to battle for the Migori woman rep seat, among them former journalist Josephine Sirega, Fatuma Mohamed and Zilpha Odline Ochuodho, who are all vying as independent candidates. Denita Ghati is vying on an Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party ticket while Lilian Akugo eyeing the seat on a Jubilee Party ticket.
