 President Kenyatta told teachers at the 45th Kenya Secondary School Heads Association (KESSHA) summit in Mombasa on Wednesday to expose students to the many ways they can earn a lot of money and not to limit them to office jobs. He claimed that blue collar jobs like farming and welding pay significantly more than white collar jobs like teaching. "Start moving away from telling our children that the only job you can have is a white collar job. That he should be a clerk in a bank, banks are going digital!!," "Leo hii kuna wakulima wanatengeneza pesa kushinda walimu, madaktari na professors. Today as we progress in ship building we are looking for quality welders and the few that we have are old men. These are paying jobs." President Kenyatta also stated that children should be encouraged to use their talents, citing the example of billionaire Bill Gates, who he claims dropped out of school and amassed a large fortune through his abilities in the market place. "This is where we need to take our children, to encourage our children. Use your gifts, that is the future. And you teachers have the responsibility to be the ones to pull that gift out of that child to be proud of himself for the service he delivers to the country," he said. "Billionaires like Bill Gates and the rest dropped out in high school and the money they have today is more that what Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi have combined." He went on to say that under his leadership, many opportunities in the education sector have been created, and that he should be commended for it. "Mimi nimewasaidia, nimewaandika walimu, mshahara nikaongeza, insurance mnazo. Pigieni kelele wale ambao wanakuja lakini mimi nipigieni makofi kwa yale nimefanya."
