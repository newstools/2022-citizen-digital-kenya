Azimio la Umoja One Kenya coalition party
presidential candidate Raila Odinga has set the record straight saying he will
not ban the importation of second-hand clothes, popularly known as mitumba, if
elected on August 9. Raila, who met the representatives from Gikomba
market on Friday, said the Azimio government will work hand-in-hand with
traders to ensure the cartels that thrive in the market through the back door
are dealt with by his administration. The traders told Odinga that they depend on
mitumba for their livelihood and those of their families, hence fearing what
would happen if it were banned. “Sisi hatuwezi tukataka
hizo statements ziendelee, hiyo politics ya mitumba iendelee…mitumba is food for
us, tukinyang’anywa mitumba tumenyang’anywa chakula. Mitumba ikitumiwa kisiasa
ni sisi tunaharibiwa biashara yetu,” one of the traders said. Kamukunji MP Yusuf Hassan,
who was also present, said: “As a community we believe that this trade should
be supported, Gikomba market should be looked into as a national market, it’s the
biggest market in East and Central Africa.” The Azimio party
chief reassured the traders that his government would collaborate with them in improving
their market, as well as setting up local industries for production of the
clothes. He further said
that his government would cancel all titles deeds of the Gikomba land being held
by private individuals and restore the market’s glory back to the traders.  Odinga, on his
part, assured them: “Wale wanyakuzi ambao wako na title ambazo wamepewa hapa na
pale, zote tutacancel ili nyinyi mweze kufanya biashara yenu hapo sawa sawa.
Msiwe na hali ya wasi wasi yoyote kwamba mitumba itapigwa marufuku…hapana,
haitapigwa marufuku, tutasaidiana pamoja.”
