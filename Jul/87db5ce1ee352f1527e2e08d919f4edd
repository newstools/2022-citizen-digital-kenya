 Maliti was seeking Machakos County’s top seat on a Maendeleo Chap Chap party ticket and has thrown his weight behind Ndeti who is contesting under the Wiper Party. The deputy governor in a letter addressed to Wiper Kalonzo Musyoka said he shelved his governor ambitions as a show of solidarity. “I have decided to walk with my sister Wavinya and I am sure she is the best leader for Machakos. I want to assure her of my support and that of my supporters,” said Maliti. He exuded confidence in Wavinya’s candidature, saying the people of Machakos are in safe hands away from political power brokers and cartels. Maliti’s quest to succeed governor Alfred Mutua suffered a blow on Sunday after his running mate Rose Wambua quit from the race and joined their rival Nzioka Waita's camp. Rose said their campaign was weighed down by the baggage of poor leadership in the county government as well as realising their ticket had become a hard sell. Waita is running under the Chama Cha Uzalendo (CCU). The Machakos governorship race is shaping into a battle of political heavyweights in the county and beyond. On top of Waita and Ndeti, it has also attracted United Democratic Alliance (UDA) Chairman Johnson Muthama and former Transport Chief Administrative Secretary Wavinya Ndeti (Wiper).
