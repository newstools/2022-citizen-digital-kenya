 In the two leaders’ pact then, Ruto had agreed to support Kenyatta’s presidential ambitions for two terms, following which he would reciprocate by backing Ruto’s bid for another 10 years. However, according to the Jubilee titan, that deal has already run its course because the two leaders were serving the country as “co-presidents.” “Yangu Kumi na ya Ruto Kumi has already happened. Uhuru has served 10 years as president, Ruto has served 10 years as co-president, you may call him a deputy president, but the Kenyan presidency is a pair,” Murathe said in an interview with KTN News on Sunday. “When Uhuru is away, Ruto is president, when Ruto is campaigning even today, he campaigns using government resources.” DP Ruto, Murathe argued, should make peace with it and run his State House race quietly without accusing the president of duping him. “When you are on a campaign platform, it’s like marrying a woman, you convince her of anything but when she comes in you live as it is,” Murathe argued. He added: “Uhuru has served 10 years, Ruto has served 10, unless they want Ruto to serve 20 years.” The vice chairperson similarly defended Wiper Party leader Kalonzo Musyoka’s decision to join the Azimio La Umoja movement on Saturday, saying it was out of patriotism and not personal interest.  “Kalonzo came into Azimio La Umoja unconditionally, he did it for Kenya, not for himself,” said Murathe.  Despite Kalonzo stating earlier that he would never throw his support behind Azimio chief Raila Odinga, uless he is “stupid”, Kalonzo shelved his preidential ambitions and backed Odinga’s bid at Azimio’s National Delegates Conference.  “Remember he had said that he would have to be stupid to support Raila a third time. Yesterday at Jacaranda he declared ‘Raila tosha, for the third time’. Kalonzo is not a mad man,” Murathe protested.
