Three people, among them a female pupil who
just sat for her KCPE examinations, on Wednesday lost their lives after the
boat they were travelling in capsized in Lake Turkana. According to reports, the boat which was
ferrying four passengers and dried fish from Marsabit to Turkana, capsized at
around 11am owing largely to strong winds that have been witnessed in the area
in recent days. Confirming the incident, Turkana County
Commander Samuel Ndanyi revealed that only one person was able to swim to shore
after the boat capsized. He is currently receiving treatment at Longech
dispensary. Owing to concerted efforts from local
fishermen and Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) officials, two bodies have since
been recovered. The search is still ongoing in a bid to retrieve the final
body.  Area Chief Peter Lotieng, on his part, urged locals
to steer clear from the lake when strong winds are recorded in the area.
