A 20-year old man is currently being held by
sleuths for allegedly kidnapping and murdering a 7-year-old boy in Kirigu,
Dagoretti, earlier this week. According to the minor’s mother, Florence Muigai,
her son left the house to go and play with other children on January 23 at
around 5pm never to be seen again. She proceeded to report the matter at Kirigu
Police Post the following day. The suspect, Maxwell Muigai, according to a
charge sheet seen by Citizen Digital, was arrested by Dagoretti-based DCI
detectives and upon interrogation revealed that he kidnapped the boy and
demanded ransom from his family. Owing to the fact that his demands were never
met, Muigai, who reports say is related to the deceased child’s father,
proceeded to murder him in cold blood. On Thursday afternoon, Muigai consequently
led detectives to the scene where he dumped the child’s body.  He is currently in custody awaiting
arraignment while the body has since been moved to P.C.E.A Kikuyu mortuary
awaiting post-mortem.
