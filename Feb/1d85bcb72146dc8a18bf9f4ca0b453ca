 According to his family, Dr. Lincoln Khasakhala who was a doctor at the Nairobi West Hospital and lecturer at the University of Nairobi was rushed to the Nairobi Hospital in July 2021 unconscious and admitted at the HDU then moved to ICU. Dr. Khasakhala had tested COVID-19 positive with his wife in March but she died soon after, leaving him weak ever since. After spending two months in the ICU, Dr. Khasakhala was moved to the HDU and later to the normal ward where he stayed in a vegetative state until his death. “By the time of his demise, we had incurred a bill of Ksh.22 million,” David, Khasakhala’s younger brother, told The Standard, adding that they managed to pay off Ksh.2.9 million with the Nairobi West Hospital. Khasakhala’s other employer, the University of Nairobi, has however refused to join in settling his bill, according to the family. “The University claims that it was not informed when Khasakhala was admitted yet he was their staff and he was away for all those months. Of course they knew he was admitted,” said David. On its part, the institution says that the Nairobi Hospital is not among the hospitals they cover for its staff. “For you to go to a private hospital not referred by us, you must get a special request and get permission to be admitted there. There’s no way we are liable for this,” the university’s corporate affairs office said. Although Nairobi Hospital has written a letter to the university requesting settling of the bill, the school maintains that the hospital should sort the issue without involving Khasakhala’s employer. Further, the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU) says it tried to intervene by requesting for Khasakhala’s discharge when the bill was at Ksh.7 million but its efforts were ignored. Nairobi Hospital has, meanwhile, refused to comment on the issue, citing doctor-patient confidentiality.
