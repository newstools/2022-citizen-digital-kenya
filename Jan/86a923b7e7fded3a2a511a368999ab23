 Interior
Cabinet Secretary (CS) Fred Matiang’i has warned that the government will
prosecute and bar elected leaders found to be inciting tribal violence from
contesting in future elections. The CS’ remarks come after the government identified
ethnic profiling linked to political inclinations around elections, as one of
the primary causes behind the latest attacks and displacements being witnessed in
Lamu County. The
ongoing violence has seen parts of the county gazetted as ‘disturbed areas’
with security agents being deployed following the death of seven people in the
region. “We
have been paying very close attention to issues in Lamu. We are determined to
ensure the ugly spectre of violence on a scale that we have regrettably witnessed
in the past years does not recur,” the Interior CS said in a statement. Matiang’i
was speaking in Nairobi on Friday when he held a meeting with elected leaders
from Lamu to deliberate on the prevailing security situation in the County. The
leaders included Governor Fahim Twaha, Senator Anwar Loitiptip, Woman
Representative Ruweida Obbo and Lamu West MP Stanley Muthama The leaders consequently pledged
to create a committee to probe causes of insecurity in the region ahead of a
planned visit by state officials next week. "The
truth is most of the elected leaders in the county won by very thin margins and
some people reason the best way to alter future election results is to ensure
members of certain communities fail to vote by displacing them," Governor Twaha
said on his part.  The
coastal leaders similarly urged the government to prioritise the issuance of title
deeds in the country to redress contested land ownership and to ensure more
local youths are employed in government projects in the region
