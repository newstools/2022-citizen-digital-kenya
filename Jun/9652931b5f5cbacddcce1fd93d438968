 Two weeks ago, Juma Jux released a song dubbed 'Simuachi' where he featured Huddah Monroe as a video vixen. In the video, the two could be seen kissing, getting cozy with one another, hence sparking reports that they could be having a romantic relationship. Speaking to the press in Tanzania, Jux said Huddah is in Tanzania to do some projects with African Boy ; a clothline owned by the singer. When asked about their relationship, Huddah said that kissing Juma Jux should not really be a fuss, since it is something 'normal'. "People kiss. Friends kiss, you can kiss your child on the cheeks. Just watch out, you can tell the energy," Huddah said adding that she is a match with Jux. The two have recently been on a public display of affection, flirting with each other on photos, videos and through Instagram texts. In one instance, Huddah referred to Jux as her husband, vowing not to ever leave him. There have been doubts on whether the two are dating, or are just creating a fuss to promote the new music and their individual businesses. However, it is not the first time Huddah and Jux are sparking dating speculations. In 2021, Jux acquired a brand new Mercedes Benz which he named 'Huddah'. Asked on why he named the car after the socialite, Jux said, "Well, it is just a name as is. I mean it is a beautiful car, comfortable, pretty." The singer has been flip-flopping on relationship issues ever since breaking up with Vanessa Mdee back in 2019.
