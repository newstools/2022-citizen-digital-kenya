Roots Party presidential candidate Prof.
George Wajackoyah has revealed another avenue his administration intends to
capitalise on in order to better Kenya's economy, should he win the
presidential race in August. Wajackoyah,
who has been vocal on legalising marijuana and commercializing the drug for
medicinal purposes, now says that Kenya can also cash in on the lucrative
anti-venom market by farming poisonous snakes and extracting toxins from them
that will enable the country to locally manufacture antidotes for export. According
to Wajackoyah, there is a ready market for anti-venom globally and once Kenya
maximises on the profitable trade it will be able to gradually pay off its
burgeoning debt. "We will introduce snake farming so that
we can actually extract snake poison for purposes of medication. A lot of
people are bitten by snakes in this country and we have to wait for snake doses
from outside the country from pharmaceutical organistaions," the exuberant
presidential candidate said on Citizen TV’s JKLive show on Wednesday. Wajackoyah
likewise highlighted that snake meat is also a delicacy in some nations, as
such Kenya can invest in anti-venom production and concurrently sell snake meat
abroad to widen its revenue generating schemes. "We
have so many snakes in this country and we have so many snake eaters. One of
the ways we are going to offset debt is by taking these snakes, extracting
poison from them and manufacturing them into anti-venom and shipping the
reptiles to other countries where they are consumed," said
Wajackoyah. Marijuana
and commercial snake farming, coupled with incentives that will boost the
country's available economic infrastructure, Wajackoyah added, will be the
first thing his administration will set out to achieve after the polls.  Wajackoyah
has in the past stated that he is prepared to counter perceived resistance
that his unique proposals would evoke among some of the country’s
residents.
