 Gitonga’s startup, Vitable Health, provides medical insurance coverage with an interest in home health workers. The 24-year-old dropped out of the Pennsylvania State University to found the business after watching his parents struggling to set a home healthcare small business going. Vitable Health gives home health workers and others a primary care-based health insurance plan with virtual and at-home visits with no copays or deductibles, according to Forbes. The Philadelphia-based company sends medical providers directly to members’ homes and workplaces or via telemedicine to provide acute and preventative care at a lower cost. Gitonga relocated to the US with his family aged 13, where his parents started a home-care business for the elderly who do not have caregivers. While still at Penn State in 2018, Gitonga won $10,000 (Ksh.1.1 million) in a college competition to bring his then-idea into life. “At the start of the semester, I didn’t know if Vitable Health was even possible – the idea was Uber for urgent care, where we’d bring the provider to you. I didn’t know if I could hire providers, I didn’t know corporate practice of medicine laws, there were just a lot of variables I didn’t know,” he said in a previous interview after the win. “In fall of 2018, I built the tech product that would enable Vitable, found a lawyer, and applied to Inc.U. I remember going to the taping the next semester, and that was the first week we’d launched.” The company has so far attracted $9 million (Ksh.1.02 billion) funding from investors.  Gitonga also boasts of previous stints at Microsoft, where he worked three stints as an intern between 2017 and 2019.
