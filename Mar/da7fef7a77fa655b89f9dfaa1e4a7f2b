Embu County Governor Martin Wambora and his
Samburu counterpart Moses Lenolkulal have met with Deputy President
William Ruto in what seems to be a looming move to join his Kenya Kwanza camp. The
DP, in a cryptic tweet on Saturday, said he was only holding political consultations
with the two ahead of the August polls. "Held
consultations with Embu Governor Martin Wambora, who is also the chairman
Council of Governors and Samburu’s Moses Lenolkulal. More to follow," the
DP wrote. However,
DP Ruto’s digital strategist and self-styled Hustler Nation Spokesperson Dennis
Itumbi later took to social media to announce that the duo had ditched Azimio
and joined Kenya Kwanza. "Two
Governors - Embu and Samburu -  have dumped Azimio today and joined
#Hustlernation saying Kenya Kwanza," he wrote on Twitter. Governor
Wambora was elected on the TNA party ticket back in 2013, while Lenolkulal was
elected on Jubilee Party.  Both
Wambora and Lenolkulal are serving their second and final terms as governors
and are yet to announce their next moves.
