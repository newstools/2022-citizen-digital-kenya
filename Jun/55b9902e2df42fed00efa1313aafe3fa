 While releasing the official voter register to the public at the Bomas of Kenya on Monday, IEBC Chairman Wafula Chebukati told the press that the names of the three would be forwarded to relevant agencies to have relevant charges pressed against them. He stated that over one million voter transfer cases had been recorded in Nairobi, Mandera, Nyeri, and Wajir counties, among others. "We are actually finalizing investigations on about 3 officers and they will be apprehended to face the law and that should be done in the course of the week," noted Chebukati. In the same vein, IEBC CEO Hussein Marjan stated that 4,000 voters may face prosecution if they were discovered to have dual registrations from different polling stations. He stated that they have so far been able to reverse 59% of the anomalies, but that their names will be forwarded to agencies for investigations to determine the cause of the double registrations. "Individuals who have registered more than once with IDs and passport numbers and ideally I would classify them as crooks. Out of that we have managed to handle 59% of the recorded 4,757 voters," noted Marjan. "What we are saying is that after the exercise we will forward them to the relevant agencies for further investigations to understand why people are registering more than once with the same documents so that proper charges can be preferred against them." Meanwhile, the elections board has confirmed that 22 million voters will participate in the August 9 general election. According to Chebukati, 2.5 million of the 22 million people have been registered in the last five years. According to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS), there were 25,212,096 eligible voters in 2017, compared to 27,857,598 in 2022. Chebukati stated that women constituted 49.12% of registrations, men 50.88%, youth 18-35 years of age 39.84%, PWDs 18.94%, and Diaspora 0.05%.
