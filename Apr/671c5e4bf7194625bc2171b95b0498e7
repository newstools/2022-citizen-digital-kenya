A family is seeking justice after their
daughter was bitten by a dog owned by a British national in Watamu, Kilifi County. Joyce Musimbi and her two children were on
holiday strolling along the beach on April 20 when the incident happened. The victim's mother claims that, a week after
the incident happened, no statement has been recorded and the suspect – Steve Dalton
- has since been released on a Ksh.10,000 police bond. “Nikiangalia tu naona mbwa imekuja inafuata
mtoto wangu…ikaanza kuuma mtoto…mtoto analia namwambia huyo jamaa control your dog,
jamaa anaangalia tu…the dog ilituterrorise over three minutes,” said Musimbi. She claims there was no help from the
suspect, forcing a witness to step in. The victim said: “We
were shouting for help and a Good Samaritan came to help us…I didn’t know what
to do, all I could do was yell ‘help’ while crying.” Musimbi stated: “Mtoto
saa hizo analia, damu iko kila mahali, ile nguo alikuwa amevaa imeraruka…it was
such a horrific scene, I saw my daughter almost dying in my own eyes while the
owner looked at me, he didn’t do anything.” They have since reported the matter at Watamu
Police Station and received the required medical attention but their quest for
justice has amounted to nothing. Police say the suspect was arrested and
released on a police bond of Ksh.10,000. “We went to the man’s
place but he refused to open the gate for us…then he started claiming that he
was the brother of the owner of the dogs,” narrated the victim.  Musimbi added: “Mtoto
alikuwa na maumivu hata usiku anashindwa kulala, anakumbuka tu hizo mbwa. Ata mkiwa
mahali akisikia kelele anasema anasikia mbwa wakibweka.”
