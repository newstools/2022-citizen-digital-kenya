 The Energy, Petroleum and Regulatory Authority (EPRA), through a statement on Sunday, said that plans to incorporate additional safety requirements in the transport of petroleum were underway, starting with defensive driving certification for all tanker drivers. The Authority further noted that it shall introduce a period conformity assessment of petroleum road tankers, as well as submission of a detailed Highway Emergency Response Plan (HERP) at the time of application for a petroleum road transportation license. “We have also set up a multi-agency team to develop guidelines that will ensure issuance of special permits to foreign registered petroleum road tankers and drivers while operating in Kenya,” EPRA stated. One person was seriously injured in Saturday's accident after two fuel tankers collided and burst into flames at Mukhonje market on the Eldoret-Webuye road. The tanker is said to have been over-speeding, according to eyewitness accounts, before losing control. The Kenya Red Cross Society said that two casualties had been treated at the scene while four shops were additionally affected by the inferno. EPRA has since established that the two tankers were loaded with export-bound petroleum at the time and had been duly licensed for transportation of petroleum by road.  Investigations into the incident are still underway.
