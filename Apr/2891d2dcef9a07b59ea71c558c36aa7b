ODM leader Raila
Odinga has called on voters in his Nyanza backyard to adopt the six-piece mode of voting in
what he termed as an effort to enhance the formation of a stable government if he
is elected president on the August 9, 2022, General Election. The methodology
requires voters to elect only ODM candidates in all six positions which will be
voted in every county during the General Election. The positions are MCA, MP,
Woman Rep, Senator, Governor and President. Odinga who spoke at
Nyasore Village in Rachuonyo East Sub County during the burial of the late Ambassador of Kenya to Qatar Paddy Ahenda says it is the six-piece mode of
voting that will ensure he forms a stable government. He further told
the Luo community and Nyanza residents to be united and form a formidable
force that will propel his journey to State House. The ODM leader
argued that there is nothing much that the people of Nyanza could achieve if
they are not united. He castigated
leaders who are dividing the Luo community on the bases of South Nyanza comprising
Homa Bay and Migori counties and Central Nyanza comprising Siaya and Kisumu
counties. Odinga was flanked
by governors Cyprian Awiti (Homa Bay), Wycliffe Oparanya (Kakamega), James
Ongwae (Kisii), Senator Moses Kajwang’, MPs Gladys Wanga (Homa Bay), Lilian
Gogo (Rangwe), Ong’ondo Were (Kasipul), Eve Obara (Kabondo Kasipul), Martin
Owino (Ndhiwa), Babu Owino (Embakasi East) among other legislators. Oparanya says they
are undertaking a lot of campaigns in the Western region to ensure Raila gets more
votes from the region.  His Kisii
counterpart James Ongwae challenged leaders in the Nyanza region to mobilize
voters to ensure they vote for Raila.
