 The State had filed an application seeking to have him detained for a period of 21 days pending the filing of formal extradition. According to police officer Walter Marunga attached to the Transnational Organised Crime Unit of the DCI DCI, Ndung'u was arrested by Interpol on a Red Notice Alert issued last year  February. The court was told that the republic of Rwanda tried him in absentia and he was convicted in absentia for selling property belonging to another person and was sentenced to five years imprisonment adding that Rwanda is in the process of forwarding the formal extradition request to Kenya. Through senior assistant  Director of Public Prosecution Catherine Mwaniki, the court was told that the release of Ndung'u on bail pending the filing of the formal extradition request is not absolute and is at the discretion of the court. "Upon the respondent's release from Parklands Police station we were informed by the Rwandan Embassy through a copy of the intended Extradition Request to the Republic of Kenya that indeed the respondent is a criminal fugitive and is wanted in the Republic of Rwanda," submitted Ms. Mwaniki. The court was told that Rwanda has no extradition treaty with the United States of America and if he returns there is a possibility of Kenya failing in its Treaty obligations. Through his lawyers Cliff Ombeta and Danstan Omari, Ndung'u opposed the application saying that he is ready to abide by court orders that will be issued to him. >..He will attend court……he knows the case in Rwanda and he has dual citizenship and has been coming back into country. The court was also told of his medical condition that he has breathing conditions and that he uses a gadget that helps him with breathing hence he should be released on bail. Magistrate Ochoi will deliver his ruling on Friday this week.
