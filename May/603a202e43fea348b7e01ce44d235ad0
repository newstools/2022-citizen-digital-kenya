 Mr. Kenyatta, while addressing Kenyans during Sunday’s Labour Day celebrations at Nyayo Stadium in Nairobi, said the decision was aimed at cushioning the country's workforce against the rising cost of living owing to external economic factors. “I today declare an increase of the minimum wage by 12pc points with effect from today,” he said, referring it as his Labour Day gift to Kenyans. The minimum wage in Kenya currently stands at Ksh.13,500 since its last review in 2018. At the same time, the President directed Labour and Social Protection Cabinet Secretary Simon Chelugui to immediately gazette Central Organisation for Trade Unions (COTU)'s representative on the National Social Security Fund (NSSF) Board of Trustees. Mr. Kenyatta similarly bemoaned the ongoing tension between Russia and Ukraine which he acknowledged has played a key role in the ongoing fuel crisis, as well as slowing down the global economy's recovery from the pandemic. “Wakati tumejaribu kuona tutafanya aje tujiokoe na tumeanza kuona barabara sasa, wengine walianza vita ambavyo hatuelewi na imesababisha bei ya mafuta kupanda na kutuletea shida zingine,” he added, noting that the challenges were beyond him. “Mambo yamekuwa magumu sio tu kwa nchi yetu…Mamilioni ya watu dunia mzima walipoteza maisha yao na mamilioni wengine zaidi kupoteza kazi zao. Hiyo haikuwa kwa sababu ya Uhuru ama mtu mwengine." Sunday’s fete saw the attendance of COTU Secretary-General Francis Atwoli, Federation of Kenya Employers (FKE) CEO Jacqueline Mugo, Nairobi Governor Ann Kananu, among several others.
