Police have arrested a businessman who was allegedly found in possession of a cache
of weapons including 22 high-calibre
firearms and 565 rounds of
ammunition. Ken Wycliff Okello
Lugwili was taken in at the Kilimani Police Station soon after the Directorate
of Criminal Investigations announced it had launched a manhunt for him on Wednesday. According to police, 22 firearms
and 565 rounds of ammunition were recovered at an office belonging to
Lugwili during an auctioneering exercise at the said premises in Nairobi’s Kilimani suburbs. Lugwili, who is linked to a company called Vic. Tecnologies, is said to
have accumulated rent arrears amounting to Ksh.4,962,990 prompting the landlord, Ballon
Wanjala Nangalama, to seek a court order allowing him to break into the
premise and auction off Lugwili's property. On Tuesday night,
police officers accompanied a team of auctioneers to the premise where they
were met with shock after they discovered an armoury in one of the rooms which
contained an assortment of weapons. They included nine
escort magnum short guns, one Benelli short gun, five Guatro short guns, one
savage short gun, six Walter pistols, and a total of 565 ammunition of assorted
different calibres. The police added
that they found: "25 pistol holsters, 9 double magazine carriers, 6 single
magazine carriers, 30 slings, 5 sniper altimeters, 10 sniper torches, and a
certificate of registration as a firearm dealer." The Directorate of
Criminal Investigations (DCI) in a statement, however, said that his license
was suspended over 3 years ago.  The Anti-Terror
Police Unit (ATPU) has taken over the case for further investigations.
