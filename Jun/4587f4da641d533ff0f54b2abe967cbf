Assistant Commissioner General of Prisons Kimega Angus
Masoro has been named the new commandant of the Prison Staff Training College
in Ruiru, Kiambu County. His appointment follows the unfortunate passing of former
commandant Wanini Kireri who died at a hospital
in Nairobi in late May while undergoing treatment after a short illness. Masoro will be deputised by
Assistant Commissioner of Prisons Majere, Priscilla Sussie. In a statement on Friday, Nixon Ng'ang'a, the director
of communications at the Ministry of Interior, said both appointments will take effect
immediately. In order to enhance efficiency at the Kenya Prison
Service (KPS), Ngang'a likewise announced more appointments at KPS. "Assistant Commissioner of Prisons Kirii Jane
Wanjiru is appointed the Regional Prisons Commander, Western Region while her
counterpart George Diang'a is appointed Director Compliance, Standards and PRO
at the KPS headquarters," said Ng'ang'a. Kireri, Kenya's
first female Commandant of Ruiru Prison Staff Training College, was laid to rest at her family home in Daiga village, Laikipia County.
