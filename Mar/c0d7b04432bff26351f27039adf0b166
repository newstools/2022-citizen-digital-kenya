 Magoha, who announced the KCPE results on Monday, said that all students are eligible to advance to the next level, including those who were found with irregularities and were given zero points in those subjects. "All of the children will transit to high school, you'll ask why yet some were caught colluding but the law says that if a child is found colluding in primary school for that subject they get zero, but they will pay for it," said Magoha. The CS further said that the Ministry of Education has already rolled out measures to ensure a smooth transition to high school. He praised parents and teachers for working tirelessly to ensure that exams were held despite the disruption to the school calendar by the global COVID-19 pandemic. "Already the ministry has put in place measures to ensure a selection exercise is conducted soonest and I dare say that within two weeks I'll be wanting to know whether it is complete or not," he said. "I wish to commend all parents and teachers for this good performance during the challenging period. I'm impressed that the mark range between the top to candidates is only three points," he added. Mahoga argued that only a few cases of irregularities were reported nationwide during the examination period, and that appropriate disciplinary action would be taken. "As far as irregularities are concerned, usually this primary exam does not have many irregularities because it is not high stakes," he said. "This time round we had 320 students who were attempting to collude in seven examination centers. There will be a price to pay by each of those candidates and the exam administrators in those centers are going to be severely admonished in the usual manner," added the CS. The exam period that saw 1,225,507 candidates sit the test compared to 1,191,752 candidates in 2020.
