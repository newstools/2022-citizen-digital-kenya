The
United Democratic Alliance (UDA) has issued a provisional nomination
certificate to Simon Mbugua to fly the party’s flag in the Starehe
Parliamentary race. This
comes after the Deputy President William Ruto-led party had last week said it
would conduct a repeat nomination exercise in the constituency due to incidences
of violence. The
race for the Starehe MP UDA ticket was largely a two-horse race between
incumbent legislator Charles ‘Jaguar’ Njagua Kanyi and Mbugua. Jaguar
had earlier on come out to dismiss claims that
he had dropped his political aspirations ahead of the upcoming August polls. “As the sitting M.P of Starehe Constituency I would like to
inform my constituents that I have not stepped down for any aspirant and I have
not held any discussions with the Deputy President in regards to this matter,”
Jaguar said in a Facebook post on April 6.  “I was elected by the people of Starehe and I have the
mandate to represent them. I will not be party to any negotiations. My opponent
agreed to negotiations in his former place. Starehe mambo ni tofauti. Tupatane
kwa debe.”
