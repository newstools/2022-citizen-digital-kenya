 Chaos was witnessed at Homa Bay county tallying
centre for the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party primaries in the wee
hours of Friday ahead of announcement of results. Police officers were forced to fire in the air
and lobe teargas canisters on aspirants and their supporters who had been
waiting at Homa Bay High School for vote tallying to begin since Thursday
night. The fracas started at the tallying hall when
aspirants for the positions of MCAs, Woman Representative and two parliamentary
aspirants (Ndhiwa and Karachuonyo constituencies) were seated patiently waiting
for the results of the primaries to be announced. Party officials who were overseeing the
nomination exercise, through security officers ordered the aspirants and their
supporters to get out of the hall which had turned chaotic. However, some aspirants and their supporters
disobeyed the orders and choose to be inside the hall, promoting the officers
to lobe teargas canister inside and outside the hall to disperse the huge crowd
who were waiting for the results. Gunshots immediately followed, causing
confusion and panic at the tallying hall. All hell broke loose within minutes as everyone
lied on the floor to save their lives from flying bullets as those who were at
the tallying centre, including journalists, scrambled for their safety. No one was injured during the incident although
some properties such as plastic chairs were destroyed, as well as window panes
shuttered.
