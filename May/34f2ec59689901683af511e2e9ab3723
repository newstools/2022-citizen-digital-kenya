Uhuru Kenyatta on Thursday at State House Nairobi, received a special message
from Angolan President João Manuel Gonçalves Lourenço. The
message was delivered by President Lourenço’s Special Envoy Ambassador
Leovigildo Da Costa Silva who was accompanied by Ms. Efigenia Dos Jorge, the
Charge d’affaires at the Embassy of Angola in Kenya. Receiving
the special message, President Kenyatta emphasized the need for Africa to speak
with one voice on international issues that have a direct impact on the continent. The
President appreciated the existing strong relations and cooperation that have
continued to benefit the people of Kenya and Angola. Ambassador
Da Costa Silva agreed that time has come for Africa to forge a united front at
the global level to guard against external factors that have a negative effect
on the continent’s progress. Thanking
Kenya for the role it played in securing peace in Angola, the Special Envoy
said his country valued its partnership with Kenya. Ambassador
Da Costa Silva also took the opportunity to reiterate his country’s message of
condolence to President Kenyatta and the people of Kenya following the death of
former President Mwai Kibaki, saying the death of the former Head of State was
not only a loss to Kenya but also to the whole continent and the world. Earlier

Ethiopian Ambassador to Kenya, Meles Alem Tekea. President

bilateral relations between Kenya and Ethiopia which grew by leaps and bounds
during his tour of duty in the country. On his
part, Ambassador Meles thanked President Kenyatta for his support that ensured
his work and stay in Kenya was fruitful.  Present
