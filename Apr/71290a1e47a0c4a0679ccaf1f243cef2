Kirinyaga
Governor Anne Waiguru on Tuesday found herself in an awkward situation after publicly referring to Deputy President William Ruto as the leader of the Azimio La Umoja coalition that is led by his political rival Raila Odinga. While
acknowledging the presence of Kenya Kwanza flagbearer Deputy President William
Ruto at the event, Waiguru accidentally addressed the DP as the leader
of the Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Alliance led by Odinga. The
Kirinyaga Governor soon realized that she had erred, after disapproving murmurs
from the crowd in attendance, quickly apologizing for her mistake. “Sorry,
Oh my goodness, my sincere apologies,” Waiguru said. Waiguru
went on to say that she made the mistake only because she had premeditated
throwing shade on the Odinga-led faction. “I
was thinking what I will say about them,” she added.   The Governor became a trending topic on Twitter with the clip capturing the unprecedented goof being widely circulated online.  The
nine parties that were welcomed into Kenya Kwanza coalition include Chama Cha Kazi,
Communist Party of Kenya, Devolution Party, Economic Freedom Party, Farmers
Party, The Service Party, Tujibebe Wakenya Party and Umoja Maendeleo Party.  According to DP Ruto, the deal signals the formation of a
formidable political outfit that will clinch power at the August General
Election and take Kenya to the next level.
