Roots Party Presidential candidate George Wajackoyah has
given a raft of conditions that ought to be implemented in the upcoming
presidential debates or else he will be a no-show. According to Wajackoyah,
there are plans to split the top four contenders into two groups which will see Deputy
President William Ruto and ODM leader Raila Odinga on one side while Agano
party's Waihiga Mwaure is pitted against Wajackoyah. Wajackoyah now says that
he wants the debates to be conducted on the same podium and he together with
Mwaure should not be portrayed
as lesser candidates. "I have credible information from those who are
arranging for the presidential debate to hold a so-called mini poll so that
they can pair Raila with Ruto and me with Mwaure, thinking that we are the
most stupid," Wajackoyah said during an interview on KTN. "They are degrading me and Mwaure. Does it mean that we
are the last remnants of society? I want us to have a head on debate. What is
wrong with all of us having the same podium." Wajackoyah further
stressed that he will not participate in the debates if his concerns are not addressed. “So
by subjecting me with Mwaure on one side and the other to on another side I
will not go, Mwaure will be on his own," he said. The 2022
Presidential Debate will be held on Tuesday, July 26, at the
Catholic University for Eastern Africa (CUEA) main campus situated in Karen,
Nairobi.
