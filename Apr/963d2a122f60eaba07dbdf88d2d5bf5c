Nairobi Governor Anne Kananu has promised to
better the county’s health and education sectors should she clinch the city's
governorship seat at the August polls. According to Kananu, who famously took over
from impeached former Governor Mike Sonko, the two sectors are vital in
ensuring that Nairobi residents operate optimally, especially those living in
informal settlements. “In my first three months in office, I will
make sure health and education are prioritized especially in informal
settlements," Kananu said at Pumwani Hospital on Saturday where she was
accompanied by over 20 city MCAs. The Nairobi Governor was donating maternity
materials, including diapers, baby wipes among other items to new-born mothers
at the facility. Kananu added that she will work closely with
the national government, Nairobi Metropolitan Services (NMS) and area residents
to ensure that her vision for the capital is realized. She likewise urged city residents to sign up
for the Linda Mama health programme and National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF)
to this effect. "As you can see, we have tried to
resolve the traffic congestion menace in the city. Our mutual working relation
with NMS has also improved the services in our capital city,” she said. She similarly drummed up support for ODM
leader Raila Odinga, labelling him as a leader President Uhuru Kenyatta’s
development agenda in matters health if he wins the race to State House.  “Our President Uhuru Kenyatta is on record
supporting health services. Raila Odinga has also promised to continue with
President Uhuru's legacy," said Kananu.
