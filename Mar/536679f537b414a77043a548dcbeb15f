The High
Court has suspended the prosecution of two sisters; Stephanie and Cheryll Murgor in a
case where they were involved in an altercation with twin brothers Eddie and
Paul Ndichu at a Nairobi hotel in October last year. The order
was issued on Tuesday to allow the hearing of a petition filed by the two sisters challenging
their prosecution over the assault case. The sisters had been summoned to appear before the Kibera law courts on Wednesday, March
23 to take plea for assault
charges. "I
have perused the Notice of Motion dated 18th March, 2022 brought under
Certificate of Urgency and the Supporting Affidavit together with the
annextures thereto. I, hereby, issue the following orders:Prayer 2 of the
Notice of Motion is hereby granted," reads the order issued by justice A C
Mrima.  Justice
Mrima directed the notice of motion be served upon the Respondents and
Interested Parties within 5 days.  Through lawyer Philip Murgor, the sisters claim that the move by the Director of Public Prosecution to charge them is maliciously intended to blackmail and coerce them into withdrawing their complaints against the Ndichu brothers. "The actions of the 1st Respondent (DPP) are illegal and amount to abuse of office for personal benefit, and are unconstitutional as they grossly violate the rights of the Petitioners as detailed in the accompanying Petition," reads the petition filed by the Murgor sisters.
