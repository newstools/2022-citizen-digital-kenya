 Kalonzo, speaking on Sunday in Huruma, Nairobi, stated that OKA principals are leaders of integrity and cannot put conditions on other people in order to work with them. “Wanasema ati OKA imetoa masharti fulani kabla ya kuungana na Azimio, mimi sio mtu wa kutaka chochote kutoka kwa mtu yeyote. Mambo ya serikali ni kunyakua na kupewa kibali na mungu,” said Kalonzo. Local media reports on Sunday linked the OKA team to demands of the presidential running mate position and key representation in government as part of an alleged pact with the Raila Odinga-led outfit. According to the reports, OKA demanded  that the country’s voter regions be mapped out among the individual political parties, as well as stipulating the candidate who will be propped up for a Nairobi County seat. Kalonzo has, however, downplayed the reports, saying although OKA is open to parties that wish to join the alliance, it will not shelve its ambitions to support another alliance. “Wanaotaka sisi tunawakaribisha OKA, sio OKA kumezwa na mtu yeyote. Mimi nimesaidia hawa watu miaka yote, mwaka huu ni wao wabadilishe waseme Kalonzo tosha,” he stated. Following the exit of Musalia Mudavadi’s ANC party and FORD-Kenya of Moses Wetangula, OKA on Wednesday signed a coalition agreement with the NARC-Kenya party. The coalition now constitutes Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Gideon Moi (KANU), Cyrus Jirongo (UDP) and Martha Karua (NARC-Kenya), who said the agreement will be officially deposited with the Registrar of Political Parties on February 28, 2022. They further announced that they have lined up a series of public engagement activities in various parts of the country.
