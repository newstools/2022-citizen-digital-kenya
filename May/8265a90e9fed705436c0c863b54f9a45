 After robbing workers of their valuables at Mabati Millers factory in Nyamasaria on Sunday, the five led police on an hour-long chase while eluding arrest. According to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI), the five entered the factory and ordered everyone to lie down before ransacking them for phones and cash. Police officers from the Nyamasaria patrol base arrived at the scene after receiving a tip from eyewitnesses, only to find the five speeding away in their getaway car, a Toyota Probox. "As the thugs staged their escape minutes later, two officers under the command of Senior sergeant Kennedy Saina, the officer commanding Nyamasaria Patrol base, arrived at the scene on foot," DCI wrote. "They tried to flag down the Toyota probox ferrying the five thugs but the vehicle sped past the officers leaving a thick cloud of dust." A chase ensued after two officers were offered a ride by nearby boda boda riders, who immediately opened fire on the speeding car, hitting the rear tyres. "In the ensuing fracas, boda boda riders who had witnessed the incident from the periphery, rushed to the scene and beckoned the officers who stood there resignedly pondering their next move, to hike a lift on their bikes and give chase," said DCI. "Senior Saina and his two officers launched a volley of fire from their firearms, that deflated the vehicle’s rear tyres." The unfortunate car came to a halt, and the thugs dashed into nearby thickets in an attempt to flee. The officers later learned that one of the thugs had been shot multiple times not far from their hiding place. One of the suspects, identified as Peter Ochieng, was then rushed at a Kisumu hospital where he is receiving treatment under tight security. The getaway vehicle was then impounded and one home-made pistol capable of firing, 5 mobile phones and an empty cash box recovered. A manhunt is on the remaining four who went into who are still at large.
