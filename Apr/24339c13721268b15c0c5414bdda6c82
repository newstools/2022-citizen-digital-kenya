 The MP aspirant wrote on his Twitter account on Monday that he is still in the race adding that he shall remain resilient in winning the seat. "Sent like an arrow from a mighty man’s hand. We keep going….. Bado Tuko kwa race. Let’s do this South Imenti, 9th August it is," he wrote. This comes after he dropped his Imenti South parliamentary bid under the United Democratic Alliance party (UDA) ticket, in favour of Mwiti Kathaara who is taking a stab at the same seat. UDA party leader Deputy President William Ruto had announced that he will be given a role in the presidential campaign team. "MC Jessy (Jasper Muthomi) will join the presidential campaign team after postponing his parliamentary bid in favor of Mwiti Kathaara for the South Imenti seat," the DP Ruto tweeted on Wednesday. MC Jessy will be hoping to unseat Kathuri Murungi who has been the Member of Parliament for South Imenti Constituency since March 2013.
