Former United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi has dropped his
presidential aspirations in favour of former premier Raila
Odinga’s bid This is despite Kituyi, in late February, announcing that he was consulting with
other political outfits in a bid to form the Sauti ya Wazalendo coalition, whose
ticket he would use to pursue an elective seat at the upcoming polls. According
to Kituyi, who was speaking when he accompanied the ODM leader during his tour
of Bungoma on Friday, he abandoned his bid after holding talks with Odinga for
the last three weeks. The
former Trade and Industry Minister continued on to ask the people of the area
to allow him to join Odinga’s political camp citing that should the ODM
frontman clinch the presidency he will also have a good chance to penetrate Kenya's political scene. In
a perceived toned-down attack on Deputy President William Ruto, Kitua cited
that one of the major reasons he joined hands with Odinga was to stop a ‘certain’
person from succeeding President Uhuru Kenyatta. “It
is important that a certain person be stopped from ever coming close to being
president,” he said. He
however reiterated that he would still pursue the Head-of-State position in the future citing that his focus, for now, is endorsing the ODM leader to the
people of Kenya.  “Na
mimi nimemuuliza mheshimiwa baba kwanza tukitembea kwetu nyumbani nitaeleza
watu wa Kenya kwamba it is good for me to aspire to be the president of Kenya,”
he said.
