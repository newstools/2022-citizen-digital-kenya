Interior Principal Secretary (PS) Karanja Kibicho has
directed police officers across the country to crackdown on goons being hired by
rogue politicians to disrupt political events. This, the PS says, comes on the back of intelligence reports
from various law enforcement agencies linking hired goons to the disruption of recent
political events in Kirinyaga County. According to Kibicho, two local politicians are at the
centre of the unrest having allegedly hired hooligans to interrupt political
rallies organized by their rivals. Speaking in Kirinyaga County on Friday when he officially
opened seven new administrative units in the area, the PS urged government
administrators to work in tandem with the National Police Service to identify
and crackdown on the said hooligans. “Kirinyaga is a peaceful county and our people are civilized
and hospitable. We cannot allow a handful of hooligans to cause chaos here and
taint the good reputation of our county,” he said. At the same time, the PS urged Kirinyaga residents not to be
duped into tolerating and endorsing divisive politics all in the hopes of
securing easy pay checks. “Insults and sponsoring chaos are retrogressive and
primitive practices, and Kirinyaga is beyond that. We must oppose leaders
corrupting the minds of our young people using cheap liquor and bhang as a
means to political glory,” he said. Kibicho likewise stated that the recruitment of new administrators
who will man the new administrative units in Mutige location and Gatugura,
Thumari, Kiandai, Githage, Raimu North and Raimu South sub-locations will
commence on Monday.  “The number of our administrative units has doubled in
Kirinyaga since President Kenyatta took over. From 87 sub-locations, we now
have 152 of them, and this speaks volumes on the government's progressive
efforts to decentralize security and citizen services,” he said.
