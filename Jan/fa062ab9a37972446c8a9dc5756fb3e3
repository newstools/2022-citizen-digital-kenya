One person has been killed following an attack by suspected Al Shabaab militants at Bobo-Hindi area in Lamu County. According to police reports, the suspected militants torched the man, John Moji, beyond recognition and later razed his house down on Monday night. Confirming the incident, National Police Service Commission chairman Eliud Kinuthia said Moji died with his hands tied up behind his back, a scene similar to 6 other people who were killed on Monday morning. Kinuthia believes that the suspected attackers are responsible for the series of deaths. He further lauded the police for their prompt response in securing the area before the suspects could extend their killing spree.
