A plane carrying eight politicians allied to the Azimio La
Umoja One Kenya coalition was Wednesday evening involved in a runway excursion
at Kakuma airstrip in Lodwar. The leaders had just finalized a political rally in Kakuma,
Turkana County. Eyewitnesses say that the plane veered off the runway after
one of its tires burst moments before it could take off. Azimio's presidential candidate Raila Odinga was not on the
plane. All occupants likewise escaped unscathed. The aircraft, registration no. 5y- spz, was among three
fixed-wing caravan planes which were part of the Azimio procession. Odinga had taken his campaign trail to Turkana County on
Wednesday as he continued to solicit support for his presidential bid ahead of
the August polls.  Earlier, Azimio held rallies in Morulem Turkana East,
Kalemorok Turkana South and Kakuma Turkana West . The convoy also toured parts
of Lodwar.
