 Speaking in Kangari parish on Sunday, Bishop Wainaina argued that it is wrong for a leader to support illegal behavior, claiming that doing so will encourage drug abuse and trafficking. He referred to these actions as wrong, unethical, and deserving of condemnation. The bishop noted that two issues—his proposal to legalize marijuana and prostitution—were of great concern. He also questioned why the relevant authorities had remained silent about bhang, which is listed as an illegal drug in the Narcotic Drugs Act. In an apparent dig at the presidential candidate, Wainaina stated that it is inconceivable for a political party to put forward a candidate for the highest office in the land who would advocate for the legalization of marijuana and prostitution. He stated that the country has historically developed a religious character that is generally God-fearing, and that there is a need to look beyond populism in a political campaign season and begin to enumerate the consequences of such potential policies. According to Wainaina, the proposals depict a high level of depravity in our society that is now rearing its ugly head. Personal integrity and discipline are required for leaders, according to Article 73(2) of Kenya's 2010 Constitution. He expressed regret that these proposals are even being made public, noting that they are already having a negative impact on our youth and children. Wainaina went on to say that the fun and games seen are highly seductive, and they are swaying the youth and children of this Nation towards dangerous inclinations. Furthermore, he stated that legalizing bhang would pave the way for the influx of other hard drugs, which are already a problem in many countries, urging authorities to take action against these deceptive claims. He also called him out for insulting church leaders and encouraging people to boycott organized and legally established religious institutions, saying he was going too far.
