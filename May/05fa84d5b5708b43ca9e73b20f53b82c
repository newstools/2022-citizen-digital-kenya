United Democratic Alliance (UDA) party Vice-Chairperson
Kipruto Kirwa has ditched the Deputy President William Ruto-led outfit for
Raila Odinga’s Azimio la Umoja camp. Kirwa announced that he had resigned from UDA during an
Azimio la Umoja rally at Sirisia Market in Bungoma County on Sunday. “I Kipruto Arap Kirwa have resigned as UDA vice-chairman.
From the moment our team unveiled the running mate last week, I knew that
democracy would be suppressed if they get into power,” Kirwa told the crowd. “I waited for Raila to announce his deputy because I cannot
stay somewhere democracy is threatened,” he added. He noted that Odinga’s running mate Martha Karua introduced
him to the camp, saying; “I called Karua yesterday and told her to take me to
Baba’s side.”
