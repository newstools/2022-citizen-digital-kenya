 A woman who was murdered and her body found on
Monday evening dumped near the GSU’s Recce squad camp in Ruiru, Kiambu County,
has been identified. Police reports say that the body is that of
18-year-old Esther Wambui, a waitress by profession, who went missing on the
morning of January 17, 2021, as she made her way to work. Wambui’s kin positively identified her body
after arriving at Juja Police Station where they were later directed to the
mortuary. According to reports, on the day in question,
the deceased was escorted by her boyfriend, Joseph Ngige, to a roundabout
bordering her workplace where he bid her farewell expecting to see her back home
in the evening. Ngige and Wambui, who are both from Nakuru,
lived together in a single room house in Ruiru. Ngige
has since expressed shock as to why his girlfriend would be murdered in such a
bizarre manner. Detectives are of the opinion that Wambui was
likely raped and killed by her murderers at a different location, before her
body was dumped. The corpse had a written message suspected to
be from the killers that read "bwana ya mtu ni sumu” when it was
discovered. Lead investigators however believe that the
message was deliberately left behind by Wambui’s murderers to derail
investigations.
