The Directorate of Criminal Investigations
(DCI) is seeking the public's help in nabbing a suspect wanted in connection with
a series of child trafficking cases across the country. Elizabeth Emboyoga Litonde is said to be the
mastermind behind a larger child trafficking syndicate said to kidnap school
going children before illegally ferrying them abroad as slaves. Police are of the opinion that the suspect
fled to Western Kenya in order to evade a dragnet that was hot on her heels.  Any person with information that may lead to
the suspect's apprehension has been urged to report to the nearest police
station.
