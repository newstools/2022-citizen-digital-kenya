Azimio la Umoja One Kenya presidential
flagbearer Raila Odinga has concluded his tour of the United States of America
and is expected back in the country. The former premier cut short the trip due to
the ongoing national mourning and planned State funeral for former President
Mwai Kibaki who died last Friday. Odinga, who met a section of Kenyans in the
diaspora as well as official of the U.S government, pledged zero tolerance in
his government should he be elected the 5th president of the Republic of Kenya. Speaking at the Centre for Global Development,
Odinga shared part of his plan on job creation and economic recovery in his
first 100 days upon taking office. “We’re going to introduce a social protection
fund for the very poor in our country, they will be getting a cash transfer
that will enable families to be able to lead decent lives,” he said. “Levels of taxation are a little bit too
high, and the net is so small. So our view is that if you broaden the net, and
you lower the level (of taxation), you’ll be able to collect more.”  Odinga is expected to jet back into the
country on Thursday.
