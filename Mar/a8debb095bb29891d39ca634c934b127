Former police spokesperson Charles Owino has
formally dropped his interest for the Siaya County governor’s seat. Owino now settles for the deputy governor’s
position after he shelved his bid and is now former Rarieda Member of
Parliament Nicholas Gumbo’s running mate in the race. This emerged on Tuesday as the two leaders joined
the United Democratic Movement (UDM) party. They were received by party leader Ali Roba,
who is the Mandera County governor and Senatorial aspirant. Owino was initially expected to battle it out
with Siaya Senator James Orengo, among others, for the Orange Democratic
Movement (ODM) party ticket at the nominations stage.  Gumbo, on the other hand was set to seek the
seat on Ugenya MP David Ochieng’s Movement for Democracy and Growth (MDG)
party.
