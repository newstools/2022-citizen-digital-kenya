 Addressing the media on Thursday, Chebukati dismissed the claims saying they were mere political antics to taint his (Chebukati's) image. Despite acknowledging that he hails from the same region as Wetangula, the IEBC boss cautioned politicians against trying to profile public servants saying: “I have remarked about profiling members of the commission and the staff and I also see an attempt by some newspapers to profile me to Moses Wetangula…it is very unfortunate.”  “He (Wetangula) is a Bukusu like me, we were born in Bungoma and I think that is perhaps the reason for profiling. As the chair of the commission, I have never sat with an individual to discuss procurement and I think it is very unfortunate that some leaders can stoop so low and try at this point in time to try and malign the character of the chair,” Chebukati said. He ultimately implored political leaders to focus on selling their manifestos rather than profiling the electoral officials. “I want to urge the politicians as you do your campaigns please focus on talking to the electorates about issues and not profiling commissioners and the staff,” he said. The statement come days after a local daily published a report that linked the Senator to Inform Lykos (Hellas) SA Holdings, a company that was awarded a tender to print and supply election materials to IEBC.  Wetangula has since rubbished the reports terming the story as malicious, and a witch-hunt against leaders holding “political opinions that are seen as going against or challenging the so-called system.”
