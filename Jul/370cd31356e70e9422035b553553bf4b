Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) soldiers on Friday
announced that they had killed ten Al-Shabaab terrorists while others escaped
with injuries during an operation between the Sarira and Kolbio areas within
the expansive Boni Forest. According
to the Ministry of Defence (MoD), the slain militants are believed to be part
of newly graduated members of a section of Al-Shabaab group dubbed Jeysh Ayman,
which is led by Maalim Ayman. The group is said to have been planning
attacks on the region and in the larger Lamu area. “During
the operation, ten newly graduated Al Shabaab terrorists were killed as others
escaped with multiple injuries,” the ministry said in a statement. “The
militants are part of the Jeysh Ayman team led by Maalim Ayman who had planned
to carry out attacks within the Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia Transport
(LAPSSET) Corridor." In the
operation, the troops also confiscated armoury from the terror group including
assault weapons and a grenade launcher. “One (1)
Rocket Propelled Grenade launcher (RPG), several assault weapons, assorted
ammunition as well as personal effects were recovered during the operation,” added
the statement.
