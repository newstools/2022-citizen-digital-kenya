 According to reports, the bus was ferrying passengers from Maua to Mombasa before the Sunday afternoon accident at the Tharaka Nithi bridge. Several photos and videos shared online showed the mangled wreckage of the bus strewn on the hillside near the infamous Tharaka Nithi blackspot. Part of the wreckage could be seen in the river. The bus is said to have lost brakes, hitting an oncoming vehicle before plunging 40 feet into the river below. Police officers and rescue teams at the accident scene said those who sustained injuries had been rushed to Chogoria and Chuka hospitals.
