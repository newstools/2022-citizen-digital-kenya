 According to the NPS, the kind-hearted waitress scribbled a little note that she passed on to the man who was, at the time, in the company of strangers, enjoying a drink. "Yesterday evening, in a social club near Madaraka Estate, as one client was enjoying himself with strangers at his table, one warm-hearted waitress felt something was amiss, and scribbled a quick note which she secretly passed over to the unsuspecting customer," the NPS said on Twitter. The little note, scribbled on a piece of paper alerted the man to be wary of the man who sat to his immediate right.  . "I dont trust the guy seated on  your right, please do not tolerate him," the brief note read. The note, however, did not state the kind of danger the man was facing. According to the police, after receiving the note, the man quickly left the pub and was reportedly safe. "Who knows what could have happened next! To the loving, caring, and responsible waitress, "a rose 🌹 for you, please!" the statement adds.
