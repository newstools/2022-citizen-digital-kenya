Garissa Township Member of Parliament Aden
Duale has insisted that the recently read 2022/2023 budget statement is not set
in stone until Parliament approves some of the proposals suggested in it. Speaking in Karen on Saturday when National
Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi joined the Kenya Kwanza alliance, Duale
noted that the budget, delivered by Treasury Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani on
Thursday, will be forwarded to Parliament on Tuesday next week for
deliberation. He went on to state that the House might make
changes to the budget or dismiss it entirely depending on how the said caucus
goes, as such some of the recommendations made in the statement should be taken
with a pinch of salt. “A Minister of Finance was telling the
country…I propose this, I allocate this…There is nothing he has proposed, there
is nothing he has allocated,” Duale said in his address. “The Speaker will refer those estimates to
the budget committee. We will re-allocate what you have allocated. We will
change what you have proposed. You are just cheating the people of Kenya; the
budget is not yet done until Parliament approves.” The former National Assembly Majority Leader’s
sentiments come after he had on Thursday labelled the budget statement as
illegal and unconstitutional.  The legislator specifically criticised CS
Yatani for allegedly partaking in the appropriation of funds for expenditure by the national
government and other State organs, despite the fact that the National Assembly
has the sole constitutional powers to do so.
