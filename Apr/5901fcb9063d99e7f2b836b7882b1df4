Raila Odinga’s camp has urged law enforcement
agencies to conduct comprehensive investigations that will lead to the
apprehension of the perpetrators behind the violent attack that targeted a
section of Azimio leaders in Kabenes, Uasin Gishu County, on Friday. In a statement issued on Saturday, Odinga’s
presidential campaign secretariat spokesperson Prof. Makau Mutua labelled the
Friday attack, which he says was politically instigated, as being savage and
despicable. He went on to say that the attack, if left
unchecked, can jeopardise the country’s peace and security during this
electioneering period. “We ask the State to leave no stone unturned
in investigating the Soy attack on Mr Odinga and his entourage in order to
bring the weight and full force of the law on those responsible,” said Mutua. Odinga’s spokesperson likewise urged Deputy
President William Ruto and his allies to condemn the incident owing to the fact
that it allegedly took place in the his perceived backyard of Rift Valley. “This incident comes amidst heightened and
dangerous campaign rhetoric by the political opponents of Azimio in UDA, the
political party led by DP William Ruto. Mr. Ruto and UDA must condemn without
equivocation this act of barbarism,” Prof. Mutua said in the statement. “Such primitive conduct has no place in any
democratic society, let alone the Republic of Kenya. Political campaigns cannot
— and will not — be conducted in a climate of violence, fear, and
intimidation.”  While urging Kenyans to maintain peace in
this electioneering period, Prof. Mutua likewise reiterated that all
politicians are constitutionally entitled to sell their agenda in any part of
the country without having to worry about any outside interference from
unwanted third parties.
