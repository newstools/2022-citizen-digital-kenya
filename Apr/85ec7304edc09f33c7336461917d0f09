The Kenya National Highway Authority (KeNHA)
has issued alternative traffic routes to motorists plying the Othaya-Nairobi
highway in light of former President Mwai Kibaki’s burial. The authority, in a statement issued on
Saturday, predicted a traffic snarl-up in the route as the major highway had
been blocked from the public to enable key government officials travel easily to
and from the State funeral. “In light of the ongoing burial of the late
former President Mwai Kibaki in Othaya, there is anticipated traffic
congestion. Motorists are therefore advised to follow traffic police
guidelines,” read the statement. Motorits travelling from Othaya to Nairobi may
use any of the three options; Kirieini-Kangema-Gacharage-Thika (B23) or
Othaya-Mukurweini-Karatina-Sagana-Thika(B27/A2) as well as Othaya-Kirieini-Kangema-Murang'a-Kenol-Thika. On the same note, those heading to Nyeri from
the burial location have been urged to use Othaya-Giakanja-Nyeri road (B23),
Othaya-Karatina-Marua-Nyeri (B27/A2) or Othaya-Mukurweini-Gatitu-Nyeri. Consequently, the multi-agency body also
implores road users travelling in and out of the affected area to consider
other routes not mentioned in order to evade congestion. “Motorists should also explore alternative
routes, especially after the burial ceremony,” KeNHA stated.
