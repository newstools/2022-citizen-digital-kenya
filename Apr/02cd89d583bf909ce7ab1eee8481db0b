 Atwoli noted that owing to Mudavadi’s long career and experience in Kenyan politics, DP Ruto should be the one to abandon his presidential bid in favour of the ANC boss. Atwoli was speaking at a COTU meeting on Saturday, which was attended by over 50 affiliate unions as a precursor to next month’s Labour Day celebrations. “Yeye hafai atolee William Samoei Ruto kofia, Ruto ndiye anafaa kumtolea kofia.” The COTU boss also slammed DP Ruto’s bottom-up economic model, saying that it is unrealistic. According to Atwoli, the economic model is founded on the premise that the less privileged in society can empower other persons who are in a similar position, which he said is impossible to implement. “I did basic economics and there is nothing like bottom-up. If someone tells you about it, he is probably insulting you. You cannot empower a poor person using a poor person. The only way to grow the economy is by putting proper policies that can spur general economic growth,” Atwoli said. “Go out there and attract the investors. Put facilities in place that can attract both direct and indirect investments. It’s as simple as that.” Atwoli also questioned the source of DP Ruto’s campaign funds.
