Murang'a Woman Representative Sabina Chege on
Tuesday failed to appear before the Independent Electoral and Boundaries
Commission (IEBC) after she was reportedly hospitalized. Sabina’s lawyers
requested the commission’s Electoral Code of Conduct Enforcement Committee to re-schedule
the hearing to a later date after she recuperates. Through her lawyers James Orengo and Otiende
Amollo, the committee heard that Sabina was admitted to Nairobi Hospital on
February 16. "The
respondent (Sabina Chege) is not in attendance today...the respondent is
indisposed and she was admitted to Nairobi Hospital on 16th and is currently
still undergoing treatment," said lawyer Amollo. "So in
those circumstances the respondent was not able to be with us...we therefore
request that we reschedule the hearing to when she might be available.” IEBC Chairman
Wafula Chebukati hence pushed the hearing to March 8, 2022, as he urged the
Woman Rep. to refrain from addressing the case in public forums. Sabina was
summoned before the IEBC’s Electoral Code of Conduct Committee after she
alleged that vote rigging in the 2017 election propelled President Uhuru
Kenyatta to victory.  "Mnajua kule Central nimeskia wengine
wakisema tuliwaibia. Kuna ka ukweli kidogo. Lakini kama tulijua kuiba, si hata
hii tutafanya ninii? Kwani wanafikiria wao ndio wajanja?" Sabina said at a
past Azimio la Umoja rally.
