 A Nairobi-based man of Indian descent was on
Friday arrested by sleuths for allegedly threatening to kill another person and
chopping him into tiny pieces. The suspect, identified as Amar Dilip Shah,
was apprehended along General Mathenge Street in Westlands. According to police reports, Shah caused a
scene by attempting to resist arrest and attacking the arresting detective but was
subdued. “What followed was a scuffle as the unruly
suspect attempted to throw kicks and punches at the detective Inspector of
Police. But the officer who is also a martial arts specialist subdued the man
effortlessly,” the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) said in a
statement. Shah is currently being held in lawful police custody
awaiting arraignment to be charged with threatening to kill.  “Resisting arrest or assaulting a police
officer, executing his duties, attracts a fine not exceeding Ksh.1 million or
imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years or both,” the DCI warned.
