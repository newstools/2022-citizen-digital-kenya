 Mudavadi told UDA supporters in Kabarnet, Baringo County, on Sunday that the Mt. Kenya region, where the majority of votes are perceived to be, is largely anchored by Kenya Kwanza supporters. Raila, according to Mudavadi, has no chance of garnering enough votes from the region and should withdraw from the race for the statehouse. "Uhuru told me that when he retires he will retire with Raila but I have observed him and I have seen it might be true because the other day we were in Mt.Kenya and I saw it is full to the brim with Kenya Kwanza supporters. The earthquake is in Kenya Kwanza," said Mudavadi. Mudavadi chastised the Azimio la Umoja outfit, calling it a "political slaughterhouse," and accusing them of preventing Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka from leaving the coalition after announcing his defection. "Azimio is a political slaughterhouse to treat people like hostages because Kalonzo has entered there, he is told he now has no democratic freedom to seek his own way," said Mudavadi. "Now look my brother Kalonzo has been left stranded in Azimio he is being told he has already put his signature and he can't leave."
