 The ANC leader claimed that his move was aimed towards creating a better government with like-minded minds adding that they will not accept a 'State project', in a thinly-veiled attack to ODM leader Raila Odinga. "Tunataka tudumishe demokrasia Kenya, hatutaki tupangiwe marafiki. Kama wewe ulikosana na Ruto usinilazimishe mimi nimkosee Ruto Katiba yetu imesema kuna uhuru wa kukaa na marafiki wako na kuzungumza na mtu yeyote," Mudavadi stated. "We will not accept a government's project in politics. I said in my speech that there are many stalled projects and I want tell you Azimio is another stalled project. We want to make a better Kenya, we want to build a better economy for the nation and that is why we have united because we are like-minded." Mudavadi, DP Ruto and Ford-Kenya's Moses Wetangula kicked off their joint presidential campaigns on Wednesday as they headed to Nakuru show grounds in Nakuru county to woo supporters for the now larger camp. The trio is set to hold campaigns on Friday and Saturday in different parts of the country as they continue to popularize their presidential bid just 7 months before the general elections. At the same time, he hit back at President Uhuru Kenyatta over claims that he (Uhuru) is disappointed in him for joining ties with Deputy President William Ruto. Speaking at a roadside rally in Baringo alongside DP Ruto on Wednesday, Mudavadi said that Kenyans are more disappointed over the poor governance under President Kenyatta. "I want to tell my friend his Excellency President Uhuru Kenyatta that you have a right to be disappointed with me but Mr. President, Kenyans are even more disappointed. Kenyans are hungry, Kenyans have a huge debt burden, Kenyans are tired. Tusidanganyane," said Mudavadi. President Kenyatta, at a meeting in State House on Tuesday, had expressed his disappointment over Mudavadi's move to partner with DP Ruto.
