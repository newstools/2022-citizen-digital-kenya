 Malala stated during a Kenya Kwanza tour of Western Kenya that police officers only need "two hands and legs" to handle firearms and do their jobs. "Kazi ya askari si nikushika bunduki tu pekee yake? Hio inahitaji masomo yoyote kweli? Kama mtu amemaliza Form Four na alipata C plus, tumpeleke university asome; kazi ya askari ni hawa jamaa ambao wako hapa wenye waliacha shule na hawakufanikiwa kumaliza shule,” Malala said. In a statement issued on Thursday, Oguna expressed disgust with Malala's remarks, calling them demeaning to police officers. "It is sad and quite unfortunate that some of our leaders continue to make statwments that not only expose their ignorance, but also to ridicule as section of our society. Quite the opposite values of a leader," said Oguna. "Malala targeted to demean members of the disciplined forces was hugely in a bad state, and is highly regrettable." Oguna went on to say that the police force should not be judged solely on the basis of educational qualifications, claiming that the force is made up of knowledgeable people from various fields. "He should further be reminded that our disciplined forces have some of the well read individuals in the country, with intellectuals, lawyers, doctors, engineers, PhD holders, surveyors, computer scientists etc," added Oguna. Malala responded to the backlash by apologizing for his comments, claiming that they were taken out of context. "I wish to categorically state that my remarks were taken totally out of context,” Malala wrote on his Facebook account. "It is in light of this that I wish to withdraw my remarks and apologise to our disciplined forces for the discomfort my remarks may have caused.”
