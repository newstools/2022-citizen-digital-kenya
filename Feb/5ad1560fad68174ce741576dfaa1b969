Kenyans living or studying in Ukraine have been urged to vacate the
Eastern European nation after it was invaded by Russia on Thursday. The alert was issued by Kenya’s embassy to Ukraine based in the
country’s capital Kyiv. “Following the escalating tensions and the attack on Ukrainian
territory by the Russian Federation on February 24, 2022, all Kenyans living or
studying in Ukraine are hereby advised to urgently consider leaving Ukraine and
stay away until further notice,” the Embassy said in a statement. “Those wishing to remain are strongly advised to exercise
increased caution.” Other African nations such as Nigeria have already announced plans to
evacuate their citizens from the country following Russia’s invasion. The invasion, according to Russian President Vladimir Putin, was
allegedly sanctioned to protect the independence of two self-proclaimed
republics within Ukraine, Donetsk and Luhansk. The two regions were captured by Russian-backed rebels after
Russia invaded Crimea in 2014.
