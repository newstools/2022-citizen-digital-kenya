 Addressing the media on Sunday, Makueni Member of Parliament Dan Maanzo, who is one the lawyers for the Wiper Party said talks to have Kalonzo be the Odinga's running mate were not forthcoming. Maanzo stated that Odinga was not keen on having Kalonzo be his running mate in the August elections. "The agreement of Azimio-OKA has legal issues. As wiper and its lawyers, we are aproaching the High Court tomorrow seeking to impeach the agreement of Azimio-OKA and I believe the court is a court of justice and will guide the political parties correctly... and we are able to prove that the current agreement is illegal and unconstitutional. That will mean every party in azimio-oka will go its own way," said Maanzo. He noted that the only reason Kalonzo shelved his presidential ambitions was so that he would be on the ballot as deputy president. "We had conducted a National Delegates Conference which authorised Kalonzo to run for president and also negotiate with like-minded parties to team up and form a coalition. But the only reason Kalonzo withdrew his presidential ambitions is so that he may run as a deputy of Raila. "Now that it seems from the indications so far that Raila Odinga no longer wishes to work with Kalonzo and his party Wiper, it is clear that there will be no Raila Odinga without Kalonzo," said Maanzo. The MP accused Odinga of being fixed on not having Kalonzo be his running mate. "The only thing that can avert this is further negotiations and nothing much seems to come out of it. Raila seems very fixed in his quest against Kalonzo's deputy presidency," he said. Odinga is expected to unveil his running mate for the August elections on Monday morning.
