 Someone allegedly hacked Kang'ata's phone number and sent false messages to over 2,000 people, claiming he sent Ksh.5,000 to each. Kang'ata said the messages were sent to his close allies who helped him host a recent political forum at Gakoigo stadium in Maragua constituency, according to the complaint filed at Maragua Police Station on Sunday. The recipients then contacted Kang'ata, complaining that they were unable to withdraw the funds and that they appeared to be locked. He claims he received a phone call later demanding Ksh.20 million in "ransom" to protect him from a possible Communication Authority investigation. The caller threatened that if he did not comply with the request, his gubernatorial campaign would be derailed as well. Murang'a south police boss Alexander Shikondi explained to the Daily Nation how Kang'ata's phone number was manipulated and ended up in the hands of the swindler. "The message is an outright technological mischief design to malign the complainant's name," he said adding that it was done by a machine that does alphanumerical masking. Kangata's mobile number was masked and used to conduct transactions without his original number being used. The illegal communications device, according to Shikondi, is purchased from Taiwan and is used by criminals to send fake texts within a set radius. He stated that the police are on the lookout for the suspects and that they are "zeroing in on one suspect."
