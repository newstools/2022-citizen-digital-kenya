 The workers, mainly cleaners in Homa Bay town and Rodi Kopany, have expressed their dissatisfaction with the county government for constantly delayed payment of their wages. Addressing the press in Homa Bay town, the workers led by Thomas Mwai are demanding immediate payment of their arrears from the devolved unit. Mwai says that their members are facing economic challenges and are unable to provide basic needs for their families due to the delayed payment of their wages. They want the county government to swing into action and pay all their arrears for the last seven months before next week. The workers have also threatened to take legal action against the county government by next week should they fail to address their grievances. However, the Chief Officer in the department of water and environment Moses Buriri assured the workers that they will start receiving their payment from Tuesday next week.
