Two
police officers on Tuesday allegedly shot themselves dead in two separate
incidents in Mombasa County. In
the first incident, Dennis Kamau Ndungu, a General Service Unit (GSU) officer, is
said to have shot himself using his own pistol at his home in Nyali. Investigating
officers who visited the scene said they had recovered exhibits indicating that
Kamau had killed himself. "Glock19
Pistol with 12 rounds of ammunition, three spent cartridges and a shattered
Samsung mobile phone was recovered at the scene and kept as exhibits,"
read a police report. “The
deceased shot himself from the right side of the head and bullet exited on the
left side using his official firearm." The
body of the deceased has since been moved to the Pandya hospital mortuary
awaiting postmortem. In
the second incident, an officer based at the Kiembeni Police Station in Kisauni
was also found by his colleagues having allegedly shot himself on Monday night. His
body was taken to Coast General Funeral Home. The
two incidences also follow another in Kiambu County where an officer attached to the presidential escort unit shot
himself dead inside the General Service Unit (GSU) camp in Juja.  A Jericho
pistol, 13 rounds of ammunition were recovered by officers who rushed to the
scene.
