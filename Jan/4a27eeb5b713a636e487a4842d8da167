 The family of Masou Bakari Tajiri, a man who
disappeared on December 5 last year in the company of two of his employees only
for his body to be found at the city mortuary bearing strangulation marks on the
neck, is demanding justice. Tajiri, a resident of Mombasa, was abducted
alongside two of his employees at Mazeras before discovery of his body in Lari,
Kiambu County, dumped in a forest. The families of his two employees who went
missing alongside him, hope to find their loved ones alive. Tajiri is reported to have been waylaid by
people who who claimed to be police officers as he made his way to Mombasa from
Thika where he had travelled together with Fahmy Bakari Shekue and Hussein Mohammed,
his employees, with the hope of purchasing a 14-seater van. According to Hussein’s father, Mohammed Hussein,
they were not convinced about the condition of the vehicle. “Kufika
Thika Hussein ndio alikuwa aikague ile gari aseme kama imempendeza, lakini
haikumpendeza,” he said. They then started their journey back to Mombasa,
a journey that was not completed to its intended destination. “Hussein akaongea
na wife wake akamweleza wamefika Mazeras, kuanzia hapo hawakupatikana tena,”
added the father. A search led them to the Nairobi city
mortuary more than 40 days after his disappearance. According to an autopsy conducted on Wednesday,
he was tortured before being murdered. Fahmy and Hussein are still at large, with
their families hoping they will be found alive. On the same day of Tajiri’s disappearance,
his neighbour Mwinyi Mwinyi Mzungu was also abducted in the same fashion.  Leaders and activists from Mombasa are
calling on the security forces to investigate the matter.
