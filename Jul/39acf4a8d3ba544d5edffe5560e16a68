The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC)
has moved to court seeking to block private investors and government officials
from allegedly grabbing public land in Naivasha, Nakuru County. According
to the court documents, the 400-acre land valued at Ksh.77,902,500 had been set
aside for the establishment of a livestock research facility by the Kenya
Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO) within
the Naivasha township. “As
a result of the irregular allocation, KALRO was deprived of the land which
served as the only National Quarantine Station for breeding livestock destined
for export/ import. That at the moment the country has no livestock quarantine
facility,” stated EACC. The commission recorded that the government
in 1904 set aside the land for government use as a livestock quarantine and had
some structures built in preparation for the same, some of which have now been
demolished. "The farm had therefore the necessary
livestock infrastructure such as poultry houses, offices, dips, residential and
irrigation facilities," noted EACC. EACC, in
the petition, named Pineapples Edge Limited, Trojan
Nominees Limited alongside former Commissioner of Lands Wilson Gachanja as
respondents. Pineapples Edge Limited and Trojan Nominees
Limited are accused of irregular ownership and transfer of the said property
while the Chief Land Registrar is questioned for authorizing the illegal
transfer. The commission now calls for the court to
revoke the titles issued to Pineapples Edge Limited and Trojan Nominees
Limited. “The commission filed the suit seeking an
order directed to the Chief Land Registrar to rectify the Register by the
cancellation of the entries relating to the issuance of Titles in favour of the
1st and 2nd Defendant over Naivasha Municipality Block 5/291,” stated
court documents. Furthermore, the suit seeks to block Trojan
Nominees Limited permanently from accessing the land premises pending the
hearing and determination of the case.
