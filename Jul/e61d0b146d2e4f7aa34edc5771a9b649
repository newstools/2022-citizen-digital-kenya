Separate explosions in
two southern Somalia towns killed at least five people on Wednesday, including
a local administrator, state radio, police and residents said. The al Qaeda-linked al
Shabaab militant group said it carried out both attacks. In the first incident,
two bombs planted in a livestock market in Afgoye town in the Lower Shabelle region
killed at least four people, police and residents said. "One bomb
exploded but caused no casualty, then a second bomb exploded, killing four
civilians," Police Captain Nur Farah told Reuters from Afgoye. The second explosion
in the port town of Marka killed its district commissioner, state-run radio
said. "The District
Commissioner of Marka, the provincial Capital of Lower Shabelle, Abdullahi Ali
Wafow was killed in terrorist explosion in the town," Radio Muqdisho said
in a tweet, citing local security officials. Ahmed Farah, a Marka
resident, said security personnel had sealed off the scene of the blast. Al Shabaab military
spokesman Abdiasis Abu Musab said the Islamist group was behind both attacks. "We killed in an
attack the Marka district commissioner and those with him. In Afgoye we killed
two soldiers in an explosion," Musab told Reuters. Al Shabaab has been
fighting for more than 10 years to dislodge the country's central government
and establish rule based on its strict interpretation of Islam's sharia law. The group frequently
carries out gun assaults and bombings of both military and civilian targets in
Somalia and has also carried out attacks on regional targets, especially in
neighbouring Kenya.
