The National Police Service (NPS) has recovered an assortment of weapons following a disarmament exercise in Elgeyo Marakwet
County. The drill is part of a 30-day dusk-to-dawn
curfew imposed on the county by Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i to
help law enforcement agencies tame banditry attacks in the region. Following the
exercise, which focuses on peace building, police were able to recover 21
assault rifles, 13 rounds of ammunition and 36 arrows from area residents. "Other successes include; arrest of 107
people for various violations, impounding of 13 motor vehicles, 14 motorcycles, 36 arrows, and recovery
of 7 cows and 18 goats," NPS tweeted.  Speaking on Thursday when he led a delegation
of senior security officers to check out the exercise's progress, Rift Valley
Regional Commissioner  Maalim Mohamed
lauded area residents for working in tandem with police to make the exercise a
success. On Wednesday police also recovered four rifles and ammunition when a similar exercise was
held in Marsabit County. A Mark IV firearm, a G3 rifle, an AK-47 and an M16
rifle as well as 7 rounds of ammunition were confiscated by police.  The rifles and ammunition are currently being held by
police pending further action.
