An uncrewed Chinese spacecraft has acquired
imagery data covering all of Mars, including visuals of its south pole, after
circling the planet more than 1,300 times since early last year, state media
reported on Wednesday. China's Tianwen-1 successfully reached the
Red Planet in February 2021 on the country's inaugural mission there. A robotic
rover has since been deployed on the surface as an orbiter surveyed the planet
from space. Among the images taken from space were
China's first photographs of the Martian south pole, where almost all of the
planet's water resources are locked. In 2018, an orbiting probe operated by the
European Space Agency discovered water under the ice of the planet's south
pole. Locating subsurface water is key to
determining the planet's potential for life, as well as providing a permanent
resource for any human exploration there. Other Tianwen-1 images include photographs of
the 4,000-kilometre (2,485-mile) long canyon Valles Marineris, and impact
craters of highlands in the north of Mars known as Arabia Terra.  Tianwen-1 also sent back high-resolution
imagery of the edge of the vast Maunder crater, as well as a top-down view of
the 18,000-metre (59,055-foot) Ascraeus Mons, a large shield volcano first
detected by NASA's Mariner 9 spacecraft more than five decades ago.
