Rwanda’s Food and Drugs Agency (RFDA) now
says that Kenyan-made chicken flavoured Indomie products are fit for
consumption. This comes after RFDA, through its Quality
Control Laboratory, conducted tests on quarantined samples of the noodle brand
imported from Nairobi-based manufacturer, Salim Wazaran Limited. According to RFDA’s Director General Emile
Bienvenu, all samples tested did not have any traces of aflatoxin or pesticide
residues as earlier feared. “Based on Rwanda FDA’s Quality Control
Laboratory results for tested samples which revealed that Indomie’s chicken
flavoured products on Rwandan market manufactured in Kenya by are free from
aflatoxin and pesticides residues,” Bienvenu said in a statement on Friday. “Rwanda FDA assures the general public that
Indomie chicken flavor manufactured in Kenya are registered and safe.” Bienvenu’s statement comes after the Common
Market for East and Southern Africa (COMESA) Competition Commission warned
member states that chicken, chilli and vegetable flavoured Indomie
products might have high levels of aflatoxins and other poisons based on reports
from Egypt’s Food and Safety Authority, which prompted Rwanda to remove the
products from its shelves. The Paul-Kagame-led nation advised importers,
distributors and retailers to quarantine the products until proper tests were
conducted on the noodle brand by relevant authorities. On Friday, the Kenya Bureau of Standards
(KEBS) allayed fears pertaining to the brands that had been banned in Egypt and
Rwanda underscoring that there was no connection between the products recalled
in Egypt and the ones in Kenya.  KEBS has already taken samples of local indomie
products and is expected to release findings from their investigations sometime
next week.
