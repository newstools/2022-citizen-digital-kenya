 The suspect, Anthony Kamau alias Anthony Kinuthe was arrested at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) on Friday, June 17. Chief magistrate Wendy Kagendo on Monday, ruled that Kamau be detained for seven days at the Terrorism Police Unit to allow the British authorities extradite him. "Pending the extradition, the suspect will be remanded at ATPU station for seven days before being released to the UK government where he is wanted to face charges of sexuality molesting minors," magistrate Kagendo ruled. The suspect stated that he is "ready to face his accusers and clear his name," but did not object to the ruling. After being granted bail in the United Kingdom on charges of sexual harassment of minors, Kamau fled to Kenya after being identified as a pedophile by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI). “The pedophile is reported to have sexually assaulted underage girls within an 11-year period from 2005,” wrote DCI. Kamau was also charged in November 2019 with four counts of engaging in non-penetrative sexual activity with one girl and inciting an underage girl to perform a sexual act, according to the DCI.
