Collins Sambaya, the 19-year-old
teenager from Vihiga County who was nailed to a tree last week for allegedly
stealing a radio now wants social media users to stop making fun of his pain. According to Sambaya, the
incident was very traumatizing and Kenyans should stop joking about his
experience. “People should stop comparing me
to Jesus or the two thieves who were crucified with him on the cross. I’m a
victim of torture,” Sambaya told The Standard. “In fact, I believe Jesus saved
me from the jaws of death,” he added, noting that the incident has transformed
him and he now wants to go back to school. “I want to become a useful person
in the society in future, after all, I went through.” The teenager, however, maintains
that he never stole the Ksh.6,000 worth radio his friends accused him of stealing
in the Friday, February 18 incident. “Why would I steal a radio when
my grandfather owns one and my uncle has at least three of them?” he posed. Sambana’s grandfather said his
grandson was nailed to the tree by one Eric Irime and his younger brother who
hail from the area. “The incident occurred at around
2 pm but I only got wind of the situation at around 5pm. The suspects came to
our home and tricked my grandson into following them into their household where
they committed the act,” Henry told Citizen Digital. “My grandson is innocent. A few
days ago, the suspects took my grandson to a nearby police station where they
reported him for allegedly stealing the said radio. Officers however freed him
after establishing that there was no evidence to support the pair’s
allegations.” Sambaya was rushed to Itando
Mission of Hope and Health Care centre after residents freed him from his
predicament and is currently recuperating.  The two suspects are, meanwhile,
still at large.
