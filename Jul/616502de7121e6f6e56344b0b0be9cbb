Kenya on Friday handed over four Chinese
nationals wanted for murder in Addis Ababa to the Ethiopian Federal Police’s
(EFP) national Interpol team. The four are:  Huang Zhipeng, Liv Jie,
Wang Ming and Chao Fu Xiuzaong, The Addis Standard reports that the quartet
allegedly murdered another Chinese national, Fu Hui, at a Chinese restaurant on
the fifth floor of Tolosa Legesee building in Addis Ababa before fleeing
to Kenya. EFP National Interpol Director, Tsegaye
Haile, stated that the suspects were arrested following a synchronized
information exchange between Addis and Nairobi, 24 hours after the Ethiopian
police placed a ‘red notice’ alert on the four. Investigations into the alleged murder are
currently ongoing. This comes on the back of a February 2022
meeting between Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai and his Ethiopian
counterpart, Commissioner General Demelash Gebremichael, at EFP
Headquarters in Addis Ababa.  The two police bosses discussed various
matters including how the two agencies would cooperate and work together to
fight regional and transnational crime.
