 Speaking on Thursday during a meeting with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Reverend Justin Welby at Lambeth Palace in London Odinga said institutions responsible for elections will ensure free, fair and transparent elections in order to ensure a smooth transition.  “The Kenyan people are coming together. I’m determined to see a more united, peaceful, and loving Nation as our country embarks on the electioneering period,” Odinga stated. He added: “This is the conversation I had with my longtime friend Justin Welby, Head of the Worldwide Anglican Communion.” The two also shared tea and the Archbishop prayed for peace and
unity in Kenya during the coming August elections. On his part, Rev. Welby lauded Raila’s commitment to maintain peace and
accept the outcome of the poll and seek redress in a court should any issues
arise in the process. Welby who also held meetings with Deputy President William
Ruto recently during his tour to London also reassured Odinga of
religious support during the electoral process. “Glad to meet Raila Odinga this week, after my meeting with William
Ruto last week. We continue to pray for the people of Kenya, and for peaceful,
free and fair elections this August,” Welby wrote on his Twitter account. Odinga, who was flanked by Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu, had
a chance to attend a noon Eucharist service conducted by the Archbishop at the
Lambeth Palace Chapel, and he partook Holy Communion.  Other Azimio allies who accompanied Odinga on his five-day tour of the United Kingdom include; Governor Hassan Joho, MP Junet Mohammed, Senator James Orengo and MP Peter Kenneth.
