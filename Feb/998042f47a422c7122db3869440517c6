 Ugenya parliamentary aspirant Daniel Odhiambo had organized a rally to launch his campaigns at the Sega Vocational Training Center when unknown people who were on a motorbike lobbed a teargas canister to disrupt the meeting. The event was temporarily halted by a loud bang, followed by a huge smoke next to the dais, prompting everyone to scamper for safety. Dr. Odhiambo condemned the incident accusing his political opponents of being behind the incident. He further warned that such behavior should not be allowed to continue whatsoever. He said that everyone seeking an elective position must be given equal opportunity to sell their policies in a peaceful environment. "Ugenya does not belong to anybody, it belongs to all Kenyans and some of our opponents want to stop our events and we are warning them that this cannot happen. We want to have peaceful elections here in Ugenya and since we are law-abiding citizens and we will always consult our security agencies," he stated. Ugenya sub-county police commander Bernard Wamugunda who confirmed the incident stated that they have launched investigations into the matter to arrest and prosecute those behind the attack. "Wametupa hii kitu na wametoroka lakini kuna askari wanawafuata na wakishikwa watapelekwea kotini. We are following the matter very closely," he said. Dr. Odhiambo stated however that they shall not be cowed or intimidated by anybody and vowed to ensure that ODM party captures the Ugenya parliamentary seat this season. "Now Ugenya has the right candidate to is Dr. Odhiambo and in fact what I can promise the people of Ugenya is that once I'm elected ODM will have an office of its own," he said.
