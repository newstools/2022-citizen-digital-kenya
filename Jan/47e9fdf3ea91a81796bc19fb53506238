 Western Kenya rights activists now want the court to summon
Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha over his sentiments on gay learners. The activists argued that Magoha’s remarks were discriminative
against a section of the society because of their ‘perceived sexual orientation and gender
identity and being in a position of leadership, the CS should face the law. “The Constitution says the State shall not discriminate against
a person on any ground, including race, sex, pregnancy, marital status, ethnic
or social status,” Western Kenya LBQT Feminist Forum program director, Becky
Odhiambo said. “The Education Cabinet Secretary has done that and should be
taken to court,” she added. Ms. Odhiambo went on to state that all Kenyans including children
are constitutionally bound to enjoy their freedoms undeterred and the CS should
not interfere. “There are no gay learners, there are learners. Children
should be accorded the freedom to study wherever they want. The same
Constitution encourages affirmative action,” Ms Odhiambo said. Another activist Caroline Rucah seconded Odhiambo’s words
saying it is wrong to assume that children do not have the right to privacy and
choice. CS Magoha triggered the discussion that has since caused
controversy on social media on Thursday when he stated that gay students should
be banned from attending boarding schools. Magoha who was addressing school heads in Kisumu instructed
that students engaging in homosexuality be limited to only day schools.  “Right now, there are contemporary cases of children who are
homosexual and lesbians, they must go to day schools close to their homes. Your
responsibility should be for the greater majority and not a few individuals. Do
not allow yourself to be intimidated by children,” he said.
