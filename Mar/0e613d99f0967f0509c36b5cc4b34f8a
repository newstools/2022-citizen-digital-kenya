The Airports Council
International (ACI) has recognized Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta International
Airport (JKIA) and the Moi International Airport in Mombasa as the best
airports in Africa. The council, which is mandated to
advance the collective interests of airports globally and access service
quality, hailed the two top Kenyan airports for their excellence and service
delivery. ACI noted that the award was a
result of surveys and analysis carried out through the 2021 period where the
COVID-19 virus had crippled the transport sector. “This new recognition is a
complement to the ASQ Awards and recognizes airports that have demonstrated
significant efforts to gather passenger feedback during the pandemic,” ACI World
Director General Luis Felipe de Oliveira said. “Your customers have spoken
and recognized the successful efforts of your team in providing a superior
customer experience during these difficult times.” Kenya Airports Authority (KAA) in
a statement lauded the recognition by the council as it vowed to aim higher to
streamline airport journey. “Good news as ACI World award
Jomo Kenyatta, and Moi Intl. Airport the 2021 award for the best airport in
Africa by size and region in the 5-15million and under 2million passengers per
year categories respectively,” said KAA. KAA Managing Director Alex Gitari
said the authority is leveraging on the industry’s best practice as it seeks to
adapt seamless passenger service at its airports in a bid to provide a safer,
faster and more streamlined airport journey. The news comes just as the
authority prepares to host the 67th ACI African Conference and Exhibition in
Mombasa between March 12-18, 2022. According to KAA, the event will
serve as a leeway for world partners to network and interact in developing
airport activities.  “It will provide an ideal
platform for aviation stakeholders from around the world to network &
develop a common vision for the future of airport activities in Africa,” KAA stated.
