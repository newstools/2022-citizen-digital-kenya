The race to be Azimio la Umoja One Kenya
coalition party presidential flagbearer Raila Odinga’s deputy ahead of the
August polls just got more interesting with another candidate dropping his name
in the basket. Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya wants
to also be considered for the gig saying he is best placed to be Odinga’s
running mate. CS Munya,
who missed out on the recently unveiled shortlist of eight candidates nominated
members for the position, says he believes he has what it takes. Speaking in
Tigania West, Meru County, where he was drumming up support for Azimio on
Friday, Munya opined that he had vast experience working with both President
Uhuru Kenyatta and Odinga whom he said he shares a cordial relationship with. “Raila
Odinga hana hiyo ya kuincite watu na kuharibia watu wengine mabiashara yao, ama
mashamba, and we’re also there to look after and work with him,” said the CS. “Raila
akiwa kinara hapo juu na Uhuru wakifanya kazi, na mimi nitakuwa hapo karibu,
kwani naenda wapi? Si mnataka niwe hapo naye?” EALA MP
Mpuri Aburi also weighed in on the issue saying the CS has been backed by the
community to be the Azimio running mate come August. “Uhuru
and Raila sat down and decided that Munya would not resign his cabinet position
and we as the Meru community we planned that number one in the community will
be number one as the running mate of Odinga,” Mpuri noted. This comes
barely a day since the coalition disclosed an eight-nominee list highlighting
the applicants who are in line to deputise Odinga.  The
shortlisted candidates are; Stephen Kalonzo Musyoka
(Wiper Party), Sabina Chege (Jubilee Party), Martha Karua (NARC Kenya), Charity
Ngilu (NARC), Peter Kenneth (Jubilee Party) Gideon Moi (KANU) Ali Hassan Joho
(ODM) and Stephen Kipkiyeny Torus (National Liberal Party).
