The
Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) has issued a
clarification on when Members of County Assemblies (MCAs) aspiring to be
Members of Parliament are supposed to resign ahead of the upcoming August
elections. In a
statement issued on Wednesday, IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati said that MCAs
eyeing MP seats will only need to quit before submitting nomination papers to
Returning Officers but not on the deadline date set for February 9, 2022. "MCAs
who wish to contest as Members of Parliament should not resign by February 9,
2022 but should resign before submitting their nomination papers to the
Returning Officers to contest as members of Parliament," wrote Chebukati. He noted
that the electoral body will give advice on the matter after the Court of
Appeal delivers its judgment. In May last
year, the High Court ruled that a sitting President, Governor, Member of
Parliament or MCA who would want to vie for any elective position before the
general elections will not need to resign before that General Election. However,
the High Court's Constitutional and Human Rights Division later held that the
Election of Ann Wanjiku Kibe, who had vied for the position of Member of
Parliament while she was a sitting MCA, was in violation of the Constitution. The court
proceeded to declare the Gatundu North constituency seat vacant. But the matter
headed to the Court of Appeal, which issued stay orders at the time. On Tuesday, National
Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi had reminded Members of County Assembly
(MCAs) seeking higher electoral seats at the August polls to tender their
resignations by February 9, 2022. According to Muturi, many MCAs might end up being
sidelined from the August General Elections if they fail to adhere to the
directive stipulated by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission
(IEBC).
