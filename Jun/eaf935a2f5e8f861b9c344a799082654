 Chebukati on Saturday dismissed Sonko's candidature on grounds that any aspirants who have been previously impeached from public office are ineligible to hold elective seats. Speaking in Narok after Chebukati's announcement, Sonko claimed that the Kenyan Constitution does not explicitly state that aspirants with any pending court cases are barred from vying for elective seats. According to Sonko, his pending court case will be determined by a three-judge bench on Tuesday, as such Chebukati should have waited for the final verdict before making the said announcement. "What Chebukati has done today is very wrong because on Monday a three-judge bench will rule on this matter instead of taking shortcuts. The Constitution says if one has been impeached and you have not exhausted all the avenues of appeal you should be allowed to vie," said Sonko. Sonko went on to question why Sirisia MP John Waluke has been cleared by IEBC despite being sentenced to prison on charges of abusing office, fraud and corruption yet his candidature was dismissed by the commission. "I have a friend who happens to be the Sirisia MP. He was jailed for 67 years and he went to prison. He appealed the verdict and was granted bail and after leaving jail he continued working as a legislator," said Sonko. "He is now campaigning to defend his seat and Chebukati has cleared him. Why not Sonko?" Sonko went ahead to purport that Chebukati's move could land him in the International Criminal Court (ICC) at the Hague for what he terms as disrupting peace so close to an election. "Haya mambo Chebukati amefanya leo hajui anaeza enda ICC kule Hague. Kwa sababu ameanza kuchochea ghasia. Chunga sana unaeza enda ICC; heshimu katiba ya Kenya," he said. Former Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu, former Kiambu senatorial hopeful Karungo Thang’wa and  Mombasa governor aspirant Chitavi Antony Mkhala were all disqualified on the same grounds as Sonko.
