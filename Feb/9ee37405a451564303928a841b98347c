A middle-aged-man narrowly escaped death on
Friday after attempting to throw his two sons into a river following an
altercation with his wife in Yatta, Machakos County. The suspect, reports say, made the attempt at
Kabaa bridge which courses over River Athi. Police officers were forced to intervene and
save the man from irate residents who had furiously descended on him with
blows.  The culprit is currently being held at Yatta
Police Station.
