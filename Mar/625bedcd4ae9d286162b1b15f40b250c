 Sonko who was formerly a member of the Jubilee party defected to the Kalonzo Musyoka-led party on Friday. The controversial politician was received by the party leader and a host of other leaders including Wiper Chairperson Chirau Ali Mwakwere. Sonko who was elected as Nairobi's second governor in 2017 was ousted in a dramatic impeachment by the Senate in December 2020 after which Ann Kananu assumed office. Prior to the governor position, he had served as the County's Senator between 2013 and 2017 before taking over from the first Governor, Evans Kidero.
