A Meru-based General Service Unit (GSU)
officer is currently in police custody for allegedly killing one of his
colleagues and injuring his superior on Tuesday night. Police Constable Abel Chumba, who was
stationed at Kaongo Kampio GSU Camp in Igembe North, is said to have shot dead
his counterpart Pontius Ikumoli and injured the Inspector in charge of the Camp
at around 9pm under mysterious circumstances. Ikumoli, according to a charge sheet seen by
Citizen Digital, was shot in the left eye and died instantly. The Inspector, on the other hand, was rushed
to Maua Methodist Hospital after sustaining a gunshot wound on his left arm.
Sleuths who processed the scene discovered 13 spent cartridges. Chumba allegedly fled the scene with his
State-issued G3 rifle immediately after committing the offence but was soon
after nabbed by GSU officers stationed at Kinisa Kongo Ambiu Outpost in the wee
hours of Wednesday morning.  The suspect is expected to be charged with
murder while the deceased’s body has been moved to Nyambene sub-county hospital
mortuary.
