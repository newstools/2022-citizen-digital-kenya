 ODM leader
Raila Odinga was on Monday back in Western
Kenya barely four days
after the Bukhungu
stadium meeting to solidify his support in the vote-rich region. Odinga was this time
in Lugari Constituency to comfort the
family of Nabii Nabwera after losing their
mother Jane Matakala. The ODM
leader used the podium in Lugari to dismiss his political rival DP William Ruto's presidential candidature, questioning the source of the millions of shillings he splashes in
his campaigns. “Anakuja kwa serikali
anakaa mwembamba baada ya mwaka mmoja ananona kama kupe… Anaenda hii kanisa anasema askofu hana
gari anakuwa mkiristo kuliko askofu… Anaita vikundi vya akina mama ati haraambee...,” said Odinga.

The former premier warned
Kenyans against
electing Ruto claiming
that Ruto's leadership
will be marred by corruption at the expense of service delivery to Kenyans.

“Kila mwezi yeye hutoa
milioni laki moja na mshahara wake ni milioni mbili… mimi najua mahali ametoa hiyo pesa ingine...,” said Odinga.

Leaders most of whom accompanied Odinga to the Bukhungu
meeting last Friday
took cue from the meeting and rallied the Western Kenya
region to vote for Odinga
in the August 9th
polls. “Sisi
tumekubali kwenda pamoja na wazee na tutakuwa nyuma ya raila odinga yeye ndio
atatupeleka Canaan,” said Governor
Wycliffe Oparanya. “Kama
wazee wa mulembe wamesema tunaunga mkono Raila Odinga
wewe ni nani unapinga?” said
MP Godfrey Osotsi. Odinga,
who was endorsed on Friday in Kakamega,
has been urged to lock the region's votes as call for the building of coalitions dominate
speeches.
