Federal Party of Kenya (FPK) leader Andrew Kutitila has defected to Wafula Wamunyinyi led DAP-Kenya party.  Kutitila ditched his (FPK) party to join the newly formed Democratic
Action Party of Kenya which is in coalition with Raila Odinga’s led Azimio la
Umoja. Wamunyinyi while receiving Kutitila and his party’s
officials on Sunday at Sikhendu in Trans-Nzoia County, appreciated the desire to work with the party saying it would change
the political landscape of the Western region.  Leo tunataka tukiwa pamoja na Wamalwa tutoe shukrani zetu na pongezi zetu kwa Mheshimiwa Kutitila na timu yote ya Federal kwa uamuzi waliouchukua kujiunga na chama chetu cha DAP," Wamunyinyi said. Defence Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa who was the Chief
Guest at the meeting termed the development a new beginning for the region
ahead of the 2022 general election. He continued to woo the two OKA principals from the region;
Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetangula, urging them to join forces in support of ODM leader Raila Odinga’s presidential candidacy. “Mimi nawaambia ndugu yangu Musalia na Weta, mkiendelea
kusalia hapo katikati mmesalia, wewe Musalia utasalia nje ya serikali tena.
Mara hii ningependa niwe nanyi kwa serikali,” CS Wamalwa said. As the competition and scramble for the Western region votes intensifies, Deputy President William Ruto and Odinga have since expressed strong interest to garner support from the two OKA principles.
