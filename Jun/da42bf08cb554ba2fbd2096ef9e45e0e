 DP Ruto confirmed in an interview with NTV on Sunday that, while several factors favored Senator Kithure, consultations and consideration of other factors at play led him to choose Gachagua. "There were so many other instruments that we were using... that I was using to arrive at....I looked at many things, I looked at what was required of a deputy president," DP Ruto said. "There were some who were favoured by gender, there were some who were favoured by opinion polls.. when I met groups, this group favoured this person while another one favoured another person," "In the end, we all settled as a team on Gachagua," The DP described Gachagua as a self-made man, a politician of repute, and a public servant whose sole goal was to help others. "Gachagua is a very passionate leader, a people's person. He speaks about ordinary people and is concerned about matters to do with farmers," DP Ruto said. "What I like about him is his passion for people issues, he is one of those leaders who are passionate about ordinary people," During the same interview, the second-in-command waded into his schism with President Uhuru Kenyatta, saying that if elected, he will not allow his deputy president to be disrespected, particularly by junior officers. Ruto, who dismissed President Kenyatta's support for his new political ally, Raila Odinga, said he was fine with the choice because the Head of State is free to choose whomever he wants. He also dismissed the likelihood of a fallout with his deputy if they are elected in August.  According to DP Ruto, his deputy would be Kenya's busiest deputy, with an office with clear duties. "This will never happen, I want to tell you, I will not allow my DP to be humiliated by junior staff, I have said as much, I have committed myself in writing, there are responsibilities that my DP will carry," Ruto said. "My DP will be a very busy person,"
