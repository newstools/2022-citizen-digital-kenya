The United Democratic Alliance (UDA) party Meru
County MCA aspirants who were deemed victorious in the primaries held on
Thursday now want to be issued with certificates. The aspirants, from 15 different wards in the
county, want the party’s National Elections Board (NEB) to hand them the
certificates so that they can present themselves as the region’s flagbearers to
the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC). Their requests follow reports on Friday that
the results might be cancelled and the exercises repeated in the said wards. This preceded a reluctance by sitting MCAs to
participate in the primaries exercise based on the assumption that they would
be handed direct tickets. The exercise however proceeded as planned
leaving the fate of the sitting MCAs in limbo. A crisis meeting to determine the
authenticity of the hearsay was held on Friday evening in Meru but Senator
Mithika Linturi, who is in charge of UDA activities in the county, was a no-show.  UDA has yet to issue any statement on the
matter, with the victors now demanding their pound of flesh while urging those
who are opposing the nomination results to file their complaints with the party
dispute and resolution committee.
