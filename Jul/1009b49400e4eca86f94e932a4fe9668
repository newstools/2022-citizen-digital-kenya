Property of
an unknown value was destroyed on Monday morning after a fire broke out at the
Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC) headquarters along Harry Thuku Road in
Nairobi. According
to the broadcaster’s management,
the inferno which started
at around 5:40am tore down the canteen, which is a stand-alone structure. KBC’s
acting Managing Director Samuel Maina told Citizen Digital that a combined team
of firefighters from GSU and the G4s responded to the incident and put out the
fire by 7:30 am. Although the wooden structure was razed down,
no casualties were reported. “Normal broadcast operations were not
disrupted as the fire did not touch the broadcasting house, the canteen is
separate from the building housing the studio,” said Mr. Maina. “We had to evacuate all staff first, including
presenters, but once the fire was contained, they resumed work,” he added.
