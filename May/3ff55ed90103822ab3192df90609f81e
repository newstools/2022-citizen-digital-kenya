 The JSC said in a statement to the media on Wednesday that the panel tasked with considering the Petitions had completed its work and had submitted its report to the full Commission for consideration. “At its meeting of 27t April 2022, the JSC considered the report of the panel on the petition initiated by the commission on its own motion, and is satisfied that the Petition discloses grounds for the removal of Hon. Mr. Justice Chitembwe Said Juma from office, pursuant to the provisions of Article 168(1) of the Constitution,” the statement reads. The petition has now been sent to President Uhuru Kenyatta for further action, according to the JSC, which recommends the Judge be removed. The most recent is the result of four petitions filed by former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko, Francis Wambua, Imgrad Geige, and David Leboo Ole Kilusu, who sought to have the judge removed from office for Gross Misconduct. In December of last year, the High Court refused to grant orders sought by judge Said Chitembwe to prevent the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) from hearing a petition to remove him from office. Justice Ong’undi noted that the application by Chitembwe is based on an allegation that he was not given sufficient time to respond to accusations levelled against him. "That to me is an issue that JSC is able to deal with. I have therefore not been shown any violation of the law to make this court grant the prayers sought by the petitioner at this point,” the court ruled.
