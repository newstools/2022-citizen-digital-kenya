For the second time in as many days,
President Uhuru Kenyatta has sharply criticized Deputy President William Ruto,
accusing him of undermining his leadership. The Head of State, who is on a tour of
Mombasa County, said he will not be distracted by the persistent attacks from DP
Ruto and his allies, adding that he will continue serving Kenyans. President Kenyatta called on Kenyans to
reject leaders whose main agenda he said looked no further beyond clinching
power. He warned Ruto and his allies to prepare for
a political battle of their lives, saying Kenyans will not be misled by what he
termed empty politicking. “Mwataka maendeleo kama haya, barabara njema,
stima, ama porojo porojo ambazo mumekuwa mukiletewa? Porojo haimalizi umaskini?
Porojo haitibu kansa…Wakenya mjiulize ni barabara gani ambayo mwataka kupitia,”
he said. President Kenyatta continued to return fire
after days of sustained attacks from DP Ruto and his allies who have questioned
the president's record and succession intentions. “Na bado kuna wengine wanasema ati hatustahili
kufanya kazi pamoja…tuendelee na malumbano ambayo hayasaidii mtu, nchi sio ya
mtu binafsi, nchi ni vitendo ambavyo vinabadilisha maisha ya wananchi…we’re
interested in continuity of programs like this, and we want to work with people
who have that interest,” he said. President Kenyatta's second day in Mombasa
saw him unveil the cancer treatment centre in Makadara, in what he says will turn
the Coast region into a global medical tourism destination. “Hiyo shilingi 20 kila siku yaweza iokoe maisha
yako na familia yako,” said the president. Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe, on his
part, said: “This is centerpiece of Universal Health Coverage…access to health,
affordable health, and excellent standards of health.”  The president said he has placed the country
on a strong foundation and called on the county governments to prudently use
allocated resources in improving lives.
