 In an address to journalists, Wajackoyah said there are spaces in the country that have not been utilised well and can be better used to grow the plant which will be of more benefit than the flowers. The law professor identified the newly-built Nairobi Expressway pillars among the grounds that can be used for bhang farming. “There are flowers planted where you are standing, for beautification purposes. That is a place which can yield regulated bhang. Even the things we have on Nairobi expressway, flowers that have died. Why do we need all that yet people are dying? All that will be bhang,” he said. The Roots Party leader, who was cleared by IEBC on Thursday has been vocal in advocating for the growing and legalisation of bhang in Kenya. Its legalisation, Wajackoyah says, will enable Kenyans to benefit from the economic benefits of the plant and also settle the country’s debts. Other than the legalisation of bhang, Wajackoyah’s presidential manifesto entails appointment of eight Prime Ministers, suspension of the Constitution for six months and implementing a four-day work week, where Kenyans only work from Monday to Thursday.
