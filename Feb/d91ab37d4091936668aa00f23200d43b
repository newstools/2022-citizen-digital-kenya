President Uhuru Kenyatta now says the newly
formed Azimio-One Kenya Alliance (OKA) grand coalition that consists of various political outfits,
among them his own Jubilee Party, will present its joint presidential
flagbearer within two weeks. President Kenyatta made the announcement on
Saturday at the Kasarani stadium indoor arena where he attended the Raila Odinga-led Orange
Democratic Movement (ODM) party’s National Delegates Convention (NDC). The Head of State revealed that the coalition will tour the country and make consultations after which they will then announce one
candidate ahead of the August General Elections. This came after President Kenyatta declared, during
his party’s NDC held at KICC on the same day, that Jubilee had fully joined
the Azimio la Umoja movement and would back whoever is selected to fly its
flag. “Tutazunguka pamoja na baada ya wiki mbili
mimi sina shaka kwamba tutarudi tuamue flagbearer wetu,” said President
Kenyatta. “Mimi ni mwana Jubilee lakini kutoka leo, kwa
fikira, kwa mdomo, kwa damu na kwa roho mimi niko Azimio la Umoja.” While exuding confidence that the now joint
coalition would floor its contestants in the polls, the President said; “Sina shaka kwamba ushindi ni wetu.” During the Jubilee
Party NDC at KICC, Wiper leader and One Kenya Alliance (OKA) co-principal
Kalonzo Musyoka requested President Kenyatta to be the patron of the coalition.  Earlier, ODM delegates endorsed their party
leader Odinga as their preferred presidential candidate as they rallied behind
Azimio la Umoja.
