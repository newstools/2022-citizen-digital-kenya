 Igathe claimed that his comments, which had only been made in the context of "seeking a more equitable platform for all Nairobians to enjoy services and opportunities," had been misinterpreted in a statement to the media on Sunday.  During a meeting with the Kenya Private Sector Alliance (KEPSA) earlier this week, Igathe claimed that some Nairobi County representatives were under the control of a cartel led by three Somali businessmen. “Nairobi has 45 MCAs, who are kikuyu, I can tell you they are all controlled by three Somalis. that is a fact. the capture is too serious. even yesterday they were doing things that are completely illegal and illicit,” Igathe was heard saying in the video, as he addressed the Kenya Private Sector Alliance. On Sunday, Igathe assured the community that his words in the future would reflect his deep respect for them.  “I would like to say that if the broader Somali community or anyone was hurt or inadvertently offended by comments made in the context of engagements on the campaign trail, I am sorry for any such offence or hurt,” the apology reads.  “Once again my conduct and words in the past, today and going forward are and will be self-evident of my deep respect for all Somalis in Nairobi and beyond,”  Garissa Township MP Aden Duale was among those who chastised the former banker, accusing him of 'profiling the Somali community.'  “The tribal bigotry shamelessly peddled in the sophisticated business arena is unfortunate and crass. It is more appalling coming from someone purporting to be learned and captain of industry," Duale said. "Profiling communities for cheap political expediency is the height of desperation. Nairobians are discerning and will totally reject such a poor project,”
