 Sonko's name was submitted to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) by the Kalonzo Musyoka-led Wiper Democratic Movement as one of those who had been cleared to run in the party primaries. Sonko, who was impeached by the Nairobi County Assembly in December 2020, will run on a Wiper Party ticket for the seat, but he must first defeat Kisauni MP Ali Mbogo, who is also gunning for the same ticket. In the duel for Mombasa’s top job, he will face off against former Mombasa
Senator Hassan Omar, who will run on a UDA ticket as well as Mvita MP
Abdulswamad Sharif Nassir, and Mombasa billionaire Suleiman Shabal, who are
seeking the ODM ticket.  He was sent packing on grounds of abuse of office, gross misconduct, and lack of capability to run county affairs, accusations that he had repeatedly denied. But the controversial politician's slate is far from chequered. He is currently facing a graft case in court and is also barred from entering the United States. In March this year, the United States government banned Sonko and his immediate family members from travelling to the US over corruption allegations related to abuse of office and bribery.
