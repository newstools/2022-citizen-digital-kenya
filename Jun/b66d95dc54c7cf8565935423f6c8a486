Chaos was on Wednesday witnessed at Muiu
Secondary School in Kaiti, Makueni County, after students attacked their
parents who were holding demonstrations against the institution's administration. The parents were up in arms calling for the
ejection of the school principal over the rising cases of
pregnancies within the school. In an unexpected turn of events, the students started
pelting stones at their parents, forcing them to flee for their safety. “We came to school in peace and requested an
audience with the head teacher in peace. But some teachers have incited the
students against us,” one of the parents said. “Tumepigwa mawe na wale watoto wetu. Huyo
mtoto atakuja kwangu aje?” The parents are calling for the immediate
replacement of the principal citing misconduct, increased indiscipline in the
school, mismanagement, further intimating that he is also a habitual drunkard. “Anakuja amelewa, anabeba miraa na bangi.
Akifika shule, anatembea tu akikula muguka huku wanafunzi wakimtazama. Hii
tunashangaa mbona mwalimu anakula muguka watoto wakiona,” another parent said. “Watoto wetu wamekuwa wazazi; wengi wao
wanasoma wakienda nyumbani saa saba kunyonyesha wakirudi.” While calling upon the government to
intervene, the parents want the principal transferred saying he is unable to
manage the institution whose performance they claim is dwindling. “Tunalilia wizara ya elimu huyu mwalimu
aondolewe mara moja,” another stated.
