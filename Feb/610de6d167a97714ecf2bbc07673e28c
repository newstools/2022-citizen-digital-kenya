Collins Sambaya, the man who was nailed to a tree in Vihiga County on Friday for allegedly stealing a radio, is presently
recovering at a local hospital. Sambaya was rushed to Itando Mission of Hope
and Health Care centre after residents were successfully able to free him from
his predicament. According to the victim’s grandfather, only
identified as Henry, his family is still in shock following the incident. While likening Sambaya’s ordeal to that of
Jesus Christ, Henry maintained that his grandson is innocent and was wrongly
accused. He similarly established that Sambaya was
nailed to the tree by one Eric Irime and his younger brother who hail from the
area. “The incident occurred at around 2 pm but I
only got wind of the situation at around 5pm. The suspects came to our home and
tricked my grandson into following them into their household where they
committed the act,” Henry told Citizen Digital. “My grandson is innocent. A few days ago, the
suspects took my grandson to a nearby police station where they reported him
for allegedly stealing the said radio. Officers however freed him after
establishing that there was no evidence to support the pair’s allegations.” Sambaya’s family now wants police to act
swiftly and bring the two suspects to book. “Honestly speaking if the suspects were
apprehended yesterday things would have been very different right now,” Henry
said.  “If they do get caught, we would like the
matter to be handled by police. I have heard rumours that they pair might have
been spotted nearby but I am not sure. Local youth are however hot on their
trails.”
