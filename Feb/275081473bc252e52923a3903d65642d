The United Democratic Alliance (UDA) has hit
back at the Jubilee Party for allegedly questioning the validity of its members. This comes after Jubilee moved to the Office
of Registrar of Political Parties (ORPP) seeking to have UDA delisted for
purportedly stealing its members. According to UDA Secretary General Veronica
Maina, Jubilee’s claims are baseless and unfounded especially since the party
is not legally mandated to audit or account for other political parties’
membership other than its own. “Since its inception UDA embarked on and is
conducting a vigorous recruitment of members in all the 47 counties,” Ms. Maina
said in a statement on Saturday. “Our county, constituency and ward
coordinators together with our robust head office team have meticulously
documented this process to guarantee accuracy.” Ms. Maina also highlighted how the party’s
membership data has been chronicled by the ORPP, which she says has done random
audits to validate UDA party’s membership. “We are surprised that you now realize you do
not have members. Your arrogance and cruelty was an effective membership
mobilization for UDA,” she added. She similarly cautioned Jubilee to expect more
departures within its ranks within the coming days, citing that members can now
use the e-citizen platform to cut ties with ruling political outfit.  “UDA Party is also inviting our bonafide
members who are over 10 million plus to confirm the status of their Jubilee
Party resignations on the E-citizen platform and if need be re-apply again for
the same,” she said.
