The US Embassy has said that Kenyan
sprinter Ferdinand Omanyala is free to travel to the United States for the Word Athletics Champions,
Oregon 2022. On Thursday, a source within the US Embassy
confirmed to Citizen Digital that Omanyala has his visa and can travel anytime he wants. The source, who could not be quoted, also
asked the media to confirm when Omanyala applied for the visa and whether there
were any other issues in the application on the part of the applicant.  This follows a statement from the sprinter's spokesperson, who told Reuters that Omanyala will not be competing in the upcoming World Athletics Championships in Eugene, Oregon, because he did not receive his visa on time to travel to the United States. "Sadly, I won't be participating in this year's world championships in Oregon. I did not get my visa in time for travel," Omanyala told Reuters via his spokesperson. On Wednesday, Omanyala had taken to social
media to express his disappointment on failing to travel over visa delays
issues. “Sad that I haven’t
travelled to Oregon yet and the 100m is in two days. Visa Delays!!!” the sprintstar wrote on Instagram.  The African champion
is among the athletes who will compete in the opening day of the championship
in the men’s 100m heats with finals set for Saturday.
