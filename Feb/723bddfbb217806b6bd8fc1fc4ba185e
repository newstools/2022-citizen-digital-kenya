 Augustine Wanyonyi was charged that on January 30 this year along Moi Avenue, he stole two Bibles of Good News version worth Ksh.2,100 at Naivas Supermarket. He pleaded guilty. The court was told that he entered Naivas Supermarket at around 3pm as a customer, went to the shelves where Bibles are sold and picked two copies. He was captured by the CCTV operators after he failed to pay for the items at the counterpoint. Upon a search, the two bibles were recovered from his pants. In his defence, Wanyonyi told the court that he stole the Bibles instead of committing suicide after realising that his house in Mukuru Kwa Njenga was demolished. According to him, his only option was to steal the two Bibles with an aim of preaching in Matatus. He said that he stole the two Bibles for himself and wife. He will be sentenced next week.
