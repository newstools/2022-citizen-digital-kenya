The United Democratic Alliance’s (UDA) National
Elections Board has announced a 50 per cent nomination fee waiver to all women
and youth members eyeing elective seats in the August polls. According to Chairman, Antony Mwaura, the
board set nomination fee guidelines for all categories with special
consideration on special interest groups such as women and youth. “The board has waived nomination fees for all
persons living with disabilities vying for positions within the party and
approved a 50 per cent waiver for women and youth aspirants,” Mwaura said at a
presser in Naivasha on Saturday. This came as it emerged that the party, led
by Deputy President William Ruto, will hold its nominations in April after the
new board was officially inaugurated. While announcing that there would be no
special aspirants in the party’s planned nominations, Mwaura reassured members
that the exercise would be free and fair. He also dismissed fears that certain persons
would receive direct nominations citing that it was up to ‘Wanjiku’ to pick
their best candidates. “The party does not have any preferred
candidate and all aspirants starting from the top to the lowest will have to
undergo through the set nominations,” said Mwaura. While calling for peaceful coexistence and
campaigns, Mwaura urged UDA supporters to maintain decorum in their engagement
and respect their competitors. “The board has taken note of the IEBC gazette
timelines and the just concluded amended Political Party’s amendment Bill of
2021 and shall issue further notice to the aspirants,” he stated. On her part, UDA Secretary General Veronica
Maina said that they were holding a three-day strategic meeting with the board
so as to come up with the rules and regulations ahead of the planned nomination
exercise.  “The party’s national election board has been
officially inaugurated and it’s keen to make sure that the nominations will be
free and fair as we don’t have a preferred candidate,” she said.
