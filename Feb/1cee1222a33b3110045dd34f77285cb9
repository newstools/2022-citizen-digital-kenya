Scientists in New Zealand have
discovered a newly-hatched ghost shark which
they say could inform their knowledge of the "mysterious" creature. The ghost shark was found at a depth of around
1,200 meters (about 3,900 feet) on the Chatham Rise, an area of ocean floor off
the east coast of the South Island. The "very rare" discovery was made
during a recent survey, the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric
Research said in a press release on Tuesday. A deep water animal, the ghost shark is
scientifically known as chimaera, with other names including rat fish, spook
fish and rabbit fish, according to the Shark Trust.
The ghost shark is closely related to sharks and rays. They are cartilaginous fish -- having
skeletons primarily made up of cartilage -- and their embryos grow in egg
capsules laid on the sea floor, and feed off egg yolk until they hatch. "You can tell this ghost shark recently
hatched because it has a full belly of egg yolk," said Brit Finucci, a
fisheries scientist who was part of the team that made the discovery, in the
press release. "It's quite astonishing. Most deep-water
ghost sharks are known adult specimens; neonates are infrequently reported so
we know very little about them," she added. The exact species of the ghost shark the team
discovered is not yet known, and Finucci said further tests and genetic
analysis would be needed. The age of the specimen makes it a
particularly rare find, and this will help inform scientific knowledge on
juvenile ghost sharks, as Finucci says other chimaera species indicate that
juveniles "can have different dietary and habitat requirements" to adults.  "Juveniles also look dissimilar to
adults, having distinctive colour patterns," she said of other chimaera
species. "Finding this ghost shark will help us better understand the
biology and ecology of this mysterious group of deep-water fish."
