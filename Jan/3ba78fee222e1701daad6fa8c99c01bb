 Updated entrance procedures for passengers arriving from Uganda, Ghana, and Rwanda were also issued by the administration. Passengers must also present a negative COVID-19 rapid test certificate with a QR code for a test performed within 6 hours of departure at the departure airport, as well as complete a PCR test upon arrival. The latest comes just days after Kenya lifted the ban on all passenger flights from the United Arab Emirates which was imposed two weeks ago. “Kenya shall do a NOTAM lifting the suspension of flights to and from the UAE  from midnight tonight,” KCAA Director-General Gilbert Kibe said on Monday. Kenya suspended all inbound and transit passenger flights from the United Arab Emirates on January 10 following Dubai’s ban of all passenger flights from Kenya over fake COVID-19 tests. "Inbound and transit passenger flights from UAE are suspended for a period of seven days. We are doing this to reciprocate a ban on Kenyan passenger flights to UAE," Kibe said then. The ban did not, however, affect cargo flights from Dubai into Kenya. In banning flights from Kenya, the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority stated that travelers from Nairobi were testing positive for COVID-19 upon arrival in the country whereas they carried negative test results. “They banned flights from Kenya due to many false negative COVID-19 PCR results. The Ministry of Health is investigating and will report findings soon. Several other African countries were red-listed as well,” Kibe said.
