The
High Court has declared null and void the section of the Election Act that
requires Members of Parliament to have a degree. In
a ruling delivered virtually from Nairobi, Justice Anthony Mrima said the
disputed provision had failed to undertake adequate public participation. The
ruling paves the way for aspirants seeking to serve as Members of Parliament
who do not have university degrees to contest in the forthcoming general
elections. The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) in
February this year directed that aspirants seeking the Parliamentary position
would be required to produce a degree from any recognized institution for them
to be cleared to run for the seat. However,
later that month, the Senate passed the Election (Amendment) Bill 2021 that
scrapped the university degree requirement for aspirants seeking elective
posts. This
came after 27 Senators voted in favour of the bill, which was sponsored by Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen, with
no single legislator opposing it.  In July, the Senate legal committee led by Nyamira
Senator Okong'o Omugeni approved the bill saying it will ensure that no Kenyan
is discriminated against as far as vying for positions is concerned.
