Former Kigumo Member of Parliament Jamleck
Kamau, who is vying for the Murang’a governor’s seat on a Jubilee Party ticket,
has announced his running mate. Kamau on Tuesday unveiled Dr. Naomi Njeri
Kagone as his deputy saying she has the experience needed to revive the economy of the
county. “Murang’a currently is doing badly in terms
of development and the county needs a leader who will change the economic
status of the county and a leader who has not been involved with corruption,” said
Kamau. “This time Kenyans should not be misled into
putting in place a government which will fail them, my appeal to Murang’a
residents is to ensure you have the right people to lead you.” Dr. Kagone, on her part, thanked the
gubernatorial candidate for having trust in women leadership saying she will
play a key role in championing the interests of women and youth.   “My duties and responsibilities will be on a complementary approach but not a competitive approach.” Dr. Kagone is the director of Kenya Chamber
of Commerce, Murang’a chapter, and holds a Doctorate of Philosophy in Entrepreneurship. She is also the Chief Executive Officer of
Voice Business Development Consulting Limited, which deals with business
capacity building and marketing.  Kamau, who is trying to clinch the Murang’a
governor’s seat for a second time, will be competing with Irungu Nyakera
(Farmers Party), Wairagu wa Maai (DP), Dr. Moses Mwangi (Safina), Micheal
Gatongo (ANC), Irungu Kang’ata (UDA), and Eng. Joshua Toro.
