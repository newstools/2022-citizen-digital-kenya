Agano Party presidential candidate David
Mwaure Waihiga now claims that he was rigged out of Lamu County's Senator seat race in
2017. Speaking when he attended the presidential
debate at the Catholic University of Eastern Africa (CUEA) on Tuesday, Mwaure
cried foul intimating that he was poised to be Lamu's Senator if the poll was
not interfered with as he claims. According to Mwaure, the electronic system
used in 2017 did not ensure a seamless voting process as had been advertised by the
Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC). "This is not my first time in expressing
an interest in leading this nation. This my sixth stab at an election and I
have been unsuccessful in the past," he said. "If you remember one of my competitors
said that people voted through the computer. I was going to be the Senator of
Lamu County but I believe that I was rigged out. It's only that I couldn't get
facts to back my claims.” Despite ceding that he has been unsuccessful
in terms of attempting to occupy elective seats, Mwaure underscored that his
time as a clergy man and his career as a lawyer have prepared him to take the
reins at State House come August. Likening himself to former U.S. President
Abraham Lincoln, who lost eight elections before becoming a statesman and later
Head of State, Mwaure underscored that his resolve to lead Kenya remains
undeterred and that he is confident of occupying the house on the hill come
August. "You must live to fight another day; I
am here because there is no room for giving up, we (Kenya) are where we are
because we have given up," he said.
