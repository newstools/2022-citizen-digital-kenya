 Waiguru was cleared along with her running mate, former county speaker David Wachira, after her initial running mate, James Kinyua, was barred from running by IEBC for failing to resign within the legal deadlines. Waiguru exuded confidence after receiving her certificate, chastising her critics who sought to undermine her bid. "They had attempted to scrap my name off the ballot, but I want to tell them that I belong to God," Waiguru said. "Those who had schemed evil against me by working hard to see to it that I will not seek re-election are finally put to shame," she said. Her clearance comes amid speculation, after she was blacklisted by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) as one of the leaders who should be barred from vying in 2022.
