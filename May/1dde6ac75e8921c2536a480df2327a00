Suna East MP Junet Mohamed has urged Deputy
President William Ruto to be courteous to Azimio la Umoja One Kenya coalition
party running mate Martha Karua as he continues to drum up support for his
presidential bid ahead of the August polls. This comes after the DP, during an economic
forum in Embu County on Friday, insinuated that Azimio presidential flagbearer
Raila Odinga only settled on Karua as his running mate because he was wary of
Kenya Kwanza’s growing influence in Mt. Kenya region and not because of her
political achievements or might. Speaking at an Azimio rally in Kilgoris,
Narok County, on Saturday, the legislator castigated DP Ruto for allegedly
using derogatory words to refer to Karua during his rallies. "Nimesikia amesema Raila amechukua mama mmoja hapa. Wewe wacha
madharau. Heshimu wamama. Yule mama anaitwa honorable Martha Karua. Wacha
madharau tafadhali," said
Junet. According to Junet, Odinga’s decision to
select Karua as his deputy is a step in the right direction for Kenya as far as
creating an inclusive government goes. His sentiments were reiterated by Kisii Senatorial
aspirant Richard Onyonka who labelled Karua as a modest and well-educated
politician. In a Twitter post on Wednesday, Karua urged
leaders to refrain from using derogatory words when referring to each other in
public, noting that political rivalries should not escalate to name-calling. "No matter where you stand, we can
disagree without insults and heckling. Because after August 9th, we will have
to still live with one another,” Karua tweeted.
