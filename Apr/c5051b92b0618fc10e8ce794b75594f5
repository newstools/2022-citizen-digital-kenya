Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana now claims that he
has been sidelined from partaking in Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Party affairs in
the Ukambani region. According
to Kibwana, Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has allegedly made it increasingly difficult
for him (the governor) to drum up support for the party’s flagbearer, Raila Odinga,
in the former vice president’s perceived backyard. “It is proving impossible to work with SKMusyoka in
Azimio in Ukambani. After he joined us, he wanted especially me out of all
Azimio structures,” Kibwana said on Twitter. Taking
to Twitter on Wednesday, Kibwana alluded that he will now take a backseat in
the Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Alliance following the unwarranted attention from the
Wiper boss, who he claims is opposing him at every opportunity. Kibwana
however clarified that he will still back Odinga in the race to State House
come August. “I have no choice but to be at peace with this sad
reality. History will ultimately judge all of us. May it be kind @RailaOdinga,”
Kibwana said. The Makueni Governor’s sentiments follow utterances he
made last week in which he urged Musyoka to endorse inclusivity in the Ukambani
region, underlining that all parties backing Odinga’s presidential bid should
be allowed to campaign for the former premier without facing any resistance
from other coalition members irrespective of past differences.  “Winning
elections is about numbers. Let all political parties that genuinely support
the 5th be welcome in and campaign for Azimio. WIPER/SKM should embrace
inclusivity, not a three-legged philosophy. Ukambani and her diaspora have 2.5
Million votes to be harnessed for Azimio,” Kibwana said then.
