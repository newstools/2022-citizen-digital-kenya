Azimio la Umoja One Kenya presidential
running mate Martha Karua now says the coalition party has the ultimate
solution for revamping the country’s ailing economy. Karua says that through the ‘one county, one
product’ plan encompassed in the Azimio agenda, the Raila Odinga-led camp will eradicate
poverty and boost the livelihoods of ordinary Kenyans if it clinches the
presidency. Speaking on Thursday at a rally in Nyandarua
County where she drummed up support for Odinga ahead of the August polls, Karua
said the political outfit holds the master plan for addressing poverty and
creating capital for the country. “Tuko na mipango ya kuinua uchumi na kila
county, ata Nyandarua, itakuwa na new product; mpango unaitwa ‘one county one
product’,” said the NARC Kenya party leader. “Tukiwa na mapato mpya kwa kila county, hawa
vijana wetu watapata kazi ata hizo familia tunasema maskini, mtu mmoja kwa
familia akipata kazi, unapata familia imetoka kwa maskini wa mwisho.” Karua urged the residents to consider Azimio’s
10-point agenda, which she said would give the nation a new face, further
laying emphasis on issues she said affect the Mt. Kenya region such as insecurity
and lack of title deeds. “Mambo ya security tumejipanga sawasawa ili
tuone kila Mkenya ako na security. Mambo ya kumiliki ardhi, title zenu
zitapatikana Azimio ikiingia,” Karua noted. “Tutakuja hapa na Raila Odinga, viongozi wenu
na yule atashikilia ardhi kuwaambia ahadi zenu zimetimizwa.”
