The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) has detected some
irregular transfer of votes in the election body's electronic register. An internal memo seen by Citizen TV dated May 25th this year drawn
by the commission's CEO to the county elections managers and
senior election officers also copied to the chairman revealed the concerns of
the commission in its preliminary review of the register which found that some
transfer of votes was effected without the required statutory forms. In the letter, the commission directed the election officers to treat the issue
as a matter of priority and immediately reverse all transfers that were not
supported by any documentation.  “Transfers happen when a voter requests and there is a form to fill which then the registration officer has to update the register if there are unauthorised cases where one finds themselves in a place they don’t want the commission investigates…,” said Chebukati. “cases of transfers without one's knowledge shall be investigated and the commission has called for all transfer forms if there are such cases they will be returned back and if an officer was involved in the illegal transfer stern action will be taken, the commission will not tolerate that…” During the voter registration drive
conducted by the commission, there were claims of alleged illegal mass
transfers of voters, however, it is not known if reports were made before the
commission. Chebukati urged Kenyans to verify their
details and ensure they were not locked out of the process. “We opened up the voter register for
verification from 4th May to 2nd June… We call upon Kenyans to be verified
electronically, sms platform and also an online platforms…,” urged Chebukati. IEBC is by law expected to have gazetted the
voter register to be used in the August 9th election by 9th June 2022.
