A suspected Kenyan terrorist with a Ksh.10
million bounty on his head has been arrested in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC). The suspect, Mombasa resident Salim Rashid
Mohamed alias Chotara or Turki Salim, police say, was released on bond in 2021
over terrorism charges before he went missing. Mohammed, who was linked to various criminal
activities in Mombasa, is believed to have joined the Islamic State in Mozambique
at the time. In a video seen by Citizen Digital, Mohamed can be seen explaining to DRC residents
that he and two other associates were en route to South Africa in the hopes of
starting over.  It is still unclear whether DRC intends to
extradite Mohammed to Kenya to answer for his alleged offences.
