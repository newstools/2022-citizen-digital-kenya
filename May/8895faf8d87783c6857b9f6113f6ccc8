 Memusi Sankok,15, shot himself using his father's pistol on Monday afternoon after taking it from a safe in his father's bathroom at their home in Ewaso Nyiro, Narok South sub-county. Police said the younger Sankok was a Form Four student at Kericho High School. In his condolence message, Odinga, who also lost his son in 2015, described the experience as painful and wished the MP’s family courage. “Hon. David Sankok, it is painful to experience losing a child, and even more so, difficult having to bury one; we stand with you during this difficult time,” the former Prime Minister said on Twitter on Monday evening. “Please accept condolences from Mama Ida and I. May God grant your entire family fortitude,” he added. Baringo Senator Gideon Moi said: “I convey my heartfelt condolences to Hon. Sankok and his family following the tragic loss of his son. You are in our thoughts and prayers Mheshimiwa during this difficult time. Take heart and find comfort in God the Almighty.”  Homa Bay Woman Representative Gladys Wanga also joined in condoling with Sankok’s family, writing: “​​My brother @olesankok pole sana for your tragic loss. The loss of a child is the most painful experience a parent can face.” The legislator is said to have had an altercation with the son over school matters, although he was reportedly not in the house when the incident took place.
