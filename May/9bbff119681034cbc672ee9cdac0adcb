 Sabrina, a Somali-Canadian professional model, shared a smattering of photos from her visit to Embu- deep in the declivities of Central Kenya- with scores of local women belting out the popular 'Firirinda' number from Kikuyu benga star Dick Wamunyonyi. "I've already met incredible rural women and men who work day in day out to grow the food that feeds their nation," Sabrina captioned several photos on Instagram. "Still, they are among the hardest hit by the impacts of the climate crisis," The looker, who stands at 5 feet 7 inches tall, towered over most of her company. She dressed down for the upcountry visit, choosing to stroll in a pair of figure-hugging navy-blue overalls, a nude cap, and a pair of Chuck Taylors.  Sabrina was appointed UN Goodwill Ambassador for IFAD in April 2020. She dedicates her efforts as IFAD Goodwill Ambassador to the challenges faced by rural women and girls.  She first made headlines in mainstream media publications when she was rumoured to be romantically linked to Idris. Fast forward, the pair have now been married since 2019. Dhowre was born on July 16, 1989, and is 16 years younger than husband Idris. The star is the former Miss Vancouver. Dhowre won the 2014 Ms. and Mr. Vancouver Pageant. She has graced the covers of multiple renowned magazines, among them, the Harrods Magazine and Versace.
