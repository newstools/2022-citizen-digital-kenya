through its social media platforms - had notified its customers that a 2kg
packet of Jogoo flour will be retailing at Ksh.99. Here, customers were only limited to four packets of  the Jogoo maize meal and their offer also extended to cooking
oil. “Mnajua serikali imefanya ile kitu kwa bei ya
unga but tunajua lazima upike mboga pia kwa hivyo tumecheza kama sisi kwa side
ya mafuta. Ni unga utakujia, cooking oil au zote zote?” Naivas notified
its customers. Citizen Digital
has established that the presidential order could not have taken effect
immediately since majority of the retailers already had unsold stock that they purchased with the old price.
