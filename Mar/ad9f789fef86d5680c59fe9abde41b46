 A 23-second video capturing the incident shows a woman screaming inside a Toyota Probox speeding on Thika Superhighway with the passenger door open. A passenger in another car recorded the horrifying ordeal as the driver of their car tried to keep up with the speeding Probox. The incident had initially been thought to be an abduction of the woman but police have since confirmed that it was a scuffle between the man and woman. The man, James Maina Kibe, pleaded guilty to a charge of reckless driving contrary to section 47 of the Traffic Act. He was fined Ksh.70,000 and his driving license was suspended. “Motorists should at all times exercise caution, responsibility and adhere to road safety. The National Police Service wishes to thank members of the public for availing information that led to the arrest of the suspect,” said police n a statement. According to police, the man and woman are lovers and were in a disagreement after a social outing within the city. “The lady wanted to alight and go home, whilst the boyfriend insisted on spending the evening together," reads a statement from the service. "During the scuffle a member of the public took the clip which was circulated online." The two are said to have presented themselves into a police station pleading with the police to close the investigation into the matter, something the service said might lead into different charges. "Yesterday, after reconciliation, the couple reported to the police purposely to withdraw the matter from police action. Police are still considering pressing charges against the motorist who endangered the lady and other road users," said police.
