Nominated Member of Parliament David Sankok
was on Thursday grilled for the second time over the death of his son Memusi
Sankok at their Narok home. Sources privy to the investigations revealed
to Citizen TV that officers sought to record further statements following
glaring inconsistencies from statements recorded earlier. More than 10 people were recorded, from
parents and staffers, at the Member of Parliament's home. This comes as the focus has shifted to the
ballistic analysis of two guns belonging to Sankok following the death of Memusi.  Police took a shotgun and Ceska pistol found
in the house for analysis and examination.
