 Musa Abdullahi Hussein (44), Mohamed Abdille (43), Ali Mohamed Abdi (37), Hussein Harun Bullo (34), Muhamed Abdirahman Issack (34) and Ibrahimbashir Durow (34) were arrested on May 27 while entering Zimbabwe from South Africa, according to reports. They appeared in a Zimbabwe court on Monday, May 30 to face charges of violating the country's Immigration Act. The court was told that they made a shady deal with "a bogus immigration officer" who stamped two passports and travel documents for a fee during the hearing. They were stopped at a security checkpoint shortly after crossing the border after officers discovered fake Zimbabwean immigration date stamps. They were found guilty and warned not to commit the same crime again. According to reports, the porous border serves as a crossroads for illegal entry into South Africa. According to reports, the syndicates take advantage of corrupt border officials in both countries to "smuggle desperate immigrants."
