Two suspected thugs are recovering at a city
hospital after they were shot by a police officer then attacked by enraged boda
boda riders while fleeing after allegedly snatching a detective’s mobile phone. The pair were undertaking
their criminal escapades along the Thika Super Highway at the Allsops
interchange taking advantage of the evening traffic snarl-ups. According to the Directorate of Criminal
Investigations (DCI), the two were terrorizing passersby robbing them of mobile
phones when they stole the cop’s phone. Unlucky for the muggers, their victim,
Corporal Hassan Mbwana, was in the company of his superior Chief Inspector
Elizabeth Lumumba and another colleague. “Elizabeth attached to DCI’s Anti Narcotics
branch and a fellow agent on the back seat jumped from the vehicle, whipped out
their firearms and fired two shots at the thugs after they defied orders to
stop," read a statement from the DCI. "The thugs who were each shot on their
legs to restrain them braved the injuries and fled towards Ruaraka." The commotion reportedly attracted the
intervention of infuriated boda boda riders who led a chase for the criminals
and cornered them. They then descended on them with blows and
kicks, inflicting serious injuries on the duo who they said had been staining
their reputation due to the current rise in similar theft cases by boda boda riders. “It took the intervention of the Officer
Commanding Ruaraka police station and a contingent of his officers to calm the
infuriated crowd and rescue the suspects, from their moment of death that had
already beckoned,” the DCI stated.  The suspects are currently recuperating as
detectives await their discharge so that they can face the wrath of the law.
