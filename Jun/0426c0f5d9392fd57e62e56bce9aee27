 NARC Kenya party leader Martha Karua has called out what she describes as Deputy President William Ruto’s lack of humility for “trying to be a co-president” with his boss, President Uhuru Kenyatta. Speaking in DP Ruto’s home turf in Eldoret on Sunday, the Azimio La Umoja One Kenya coalition party deputy president nominee said Dr. Ruto’s behavior was to blame for the animosity which has been witnessed in the two leaders’ second term in office. Ms. Karua told supporters to vote for Azimio chief Raila Odinga in the August General Election, saying her relationship with Mr. Odinga will be better because she understands the role of a  deputy president. “I want to assure you that I will be his (Odinga's) support, just like he picked me to be his deputy, I will be his supporter and we will work hand in hand, the type of wrangles you are seeing now will not be heard when I am in that office,” she told the crowd. “Everyone should know their role, if you are a deputy then operate in that capacity. There cannot be two chairpersons in one meeting, or two presidents in a country. Do not try to be a mini-president.” She further criticized the DP for taking on the Head of State in a manner she deemed disrespectful, saying that Ruto should respect the country’s highest office, which he has been campaigning to get into in August. “And if you are seeking the presidency, respect the one currently in that office because you’ll also want to be respected when you get there,” she said. “This does not mean that you should not correct leaders, criticize them but respectfully and on valid grounds.” Karua’s tour of Uasin Gishu county was her first since she was named Odinga’s running mate in the August 9 race to State House. The Azimio running mate had earlier attended a church service in a local church and  was accompanied by nominated MP Maina Kamanda among other Azimio-allied leaders.
