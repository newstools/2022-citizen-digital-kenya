 According to the Ministry of Labour, the current Employment, Labour Institutions and Labour Relations Acts governing employer-employee relationships do not cover forced pay cuts, unpaid leave policies, as well as remote and hybrid work models. "While the labour laws provide for what people should do, they did not anticipate this kind of situation,” Labour Principal Secretary Peter Tum was quoted as saying by Business Daily. “There’s a need now to relook into the same laws to factor in the emergence of such challenges." The three acts, all enacted in 2007, ​​allow employers to cut workers’ salaries during financial crises upon consultation and agreement by the employee, or where a worker has been demoted. An employee who is not content with the cut can file a complaint with the labour office or sue within three years. Although the Employment Act allows employees to access unpaid leave, it does not guide employers on how to do it. The review will clarify the period when the salary cuts remain effective as well as stipulating the conditions for unpaid leave and pay cuts.
