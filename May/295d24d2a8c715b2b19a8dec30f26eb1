 The two are accused of assaulting their Biology and Agriculture after waylaying him on his way home at night, fracturing his right hand using blunt objects. Josphat Kiplimo, 22, and Collins Kipruto, 18, are said to have been infuriated by the teacher who had reprimanded them for disrupting the queue during lunchtime. The incident sparked an uproar among the education stakeholders prompting police to arrest the two students who are locked up in Kobujoi Police Station awaiting arraignment. The arrests came a day after the Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers(KUPPET) stormed Nandi South education offices demanding that action be taken against the two students. The union threatened to withdraw their members from the school if their security would not be guaranteed.
