 Isaak Mwangi Wakanyi, 46, was accused of abducting the minor while on her way from school on September 5, 2013 before committing the heinous acts. According to the case witnesses, the pupil’s body was found dumped along the road by pupils on their way to school the next morning. In his ruling on Monday, Justice Kanyi Kimondo said the case had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt before handing Wakanyi the sentence. “The accused assaulted and strangled an innocent five-year-old for his own gratification thus he must bear the consequence,” ruled Justice Kimondo, ‘I sentence him to serve 20 years in prison.” The jail term runs from September 6, 2013 when the convict was placed in police custody.
