 In a statement issued on Tuesday evening, the DCI said the suspect identified as Zachariah Nyaora Obadia was scientifically placed at the crime scene before he was traced down to Mukuru Kaiyaba informal settlement. According to the DCI, Nyaora was traced by sleuths drawn from Crime Research and Intelligence Bureau (CRIB) and DCI Nairobi but he however managed to narrowly escape the detectives’ dragnet through a sewer duct in the
densely populated settlement. The suspect
is also said to have been positively identified on the video capturing the sexual
assault incident by his wife and other relatives in his rural home.  “It is only a matter of time before we arrest him. The DCI is cautioning Zacharia Nyaora not to engage detectives in cat and mouse games but to surrender at DCI headquarters or the nearest Police station within 24 hours,” reads the statement. The multi-agency team added: “His accomplices who were within the vicinity of the barbaric attack whether captured on the video clip or not, have all been identified scientifically. ordered to submit themselves at DCI headquarters before detectives catch up with them.”
