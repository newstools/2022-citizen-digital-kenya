Jeriel Ndeda Obura, the top student
in the 2021 Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) exam, wants to
pursue a degree in medicine at Maseno University. Obura, who studied at Mang’u High
School, got an A score of 87.16 points. Obura said he has always had an
interest in biology, ever since he made the transition from primary to
secondary education and this is what spurred him to apply for a medicine course
at the Kisumu County-based university. Obura said the news that he emerged
top nationally came as a surprise to him, noting that he had predicted that he
would score an A of 84 points, which was three points lower than what he
managed to attain. “I am very happy. I have always put
efforts in my studies. When I did the exams, I thought I would get an A of 84
points because I found all the subjects manageable; when I heard I was the
first in the country I was overjoyed. I did not think I would be top of the
class,” Obura told Citizen TV in a phone interview on Saturday. He specifically thanked three of
his friends - Hassan, Nyabuto and Mobisa - for encouraging him to not let up in
his studies. The trio predicted that he would emerge top nationally.  “They were the first to call me
when they heard my name. I did not always come out the top of my class; from
time to time someone would come in first before me, but I just believed in
myself and kept going,” he said.
