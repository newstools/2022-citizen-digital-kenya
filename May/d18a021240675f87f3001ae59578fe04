A United Airlines passenger was taken into
custody Thursday morning at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport after
opening an aircraft door and walking out onto the wing of the plane while it
was taxiing. "A male subject was onboard a plane that
was approaching the gate when he pulled the emergency exit and walked out onto
the wing of the plane," according to a statement from the Chicago Police
Department. "The subject then slid down the wing and
onto the airfield," police added. The incident occurred on United Airlines
flight 2478 coming from San Diego. United Airlines said ground crew stopped the
individual outside the aircraft. When the plane arrived at the gate, all
passengers deplaned safely, according to a statement from the airline. "CPD arrived and placed him into custody.
Charges are pending," police said.
