Saudi
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has landed in the Turkish capital, Ankara, for a first visit to the country
since the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the kingdom's Istanbul consulate. The
visit began with a welcome ceremony, and will be followed by a one-on-one
meeting between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the crown prince. The
trip comes as the West and wider Middle East seek to repair relations with the
oil-rich kingdom, in a bid to alleviate financial strains prompted by the
pandemic and sky-high energy prices sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In
April, Erdogan met the crown prince in the Saudi city of Jeddah, a visit that
ended the years-long diplomatic standoff between the two countries. The
crown prince -- known as MBS -- is the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia. A wave
of crackdowns on Saudi dissidents, which culminated in Khashoggi's murder by a
15-man hit squad, strained relations between Riyadh and multiple Western states
and Turkey. However,
then-US President Donald Trump stood by MBS -- who was a lynchpin of Trump's
Middle East policy -- even as the CIA said they believed the crown prince approved the murder at the
consulate. According
to Turkish official sources, a Saudi forensic expert equipped with a bone saw
dismembered Khashoggi's body after he was killed in the Istanbul consulate in
October 2018. MBS denied involvement in the murder, which captured
international headlines with lurid details of the killing. Erdogan
spoke out strongly against the murder, launching a probe into the killing, and
diplomatic relations between the two countries broke down. But
a plummeting Turkish lira and inflation of more than 70% appear to have forced
the Turkish President to change tack. For months, Ankara has made overtures to
Riyadh — as well as Saudi's closest Gulf ally, Abu Dhabi — to mend relations,
including ending Khashoggi's murder trial in April and transferring the case to Riyadh. Rights
groups have condemned the move, arguing it would kill off the case. Khashoggi's
fiancée, Hatice Cengiz, an outspoken advocate for justice for the slain Saudi
critic, said her legal team would appeal the decision. However,
