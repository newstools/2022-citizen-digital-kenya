A cloud of pain hangs over the Baringo
Referral Hospital where 3 boys are receiving treatment for injuries allegedly
inflicted by a pastor. The man of the cloth, Joseph Muduma, and two others
are said to have tortured the boys by strangling and then burning their feet
for allegedly stealing cake worth Ksh.80. One of the boys, who works for the pastor,
explained how he was tortured into naming his friends as accomplices. “Tukaenda jikoni nikaona moto, haikuwa na
kuni but ilikuwa ile ya red red, akaniambia simamia moto ama useme ni nani,”
said the boy. “Nikajaribu kusimamia moto ilikuwa kali sana,
nikaruka na hapo ndio alinishikilia; kijana wake mmoja alinishika kichwa na
mwengine mkono, ndio akanifinyilia kwa moto.” The other said: “Alinichukua akanishikilia
mguu kwa moto, akanitoa nje akanitolea manguo yote akaanza kunipiga mangumi ya
usp akanikanyaga kichwa.” Neighbours in Kaptimbor estate in Kabarnet
heard the boys’ cry and came to their rescue. The pastor and one of his accomplices named Daniel
Cherop were arraigned on Thursday as police continue the search for the third
suspect.  The two will be detained for 5 days pending
investigations.
