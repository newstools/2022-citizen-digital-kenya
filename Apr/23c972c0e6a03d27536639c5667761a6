 Speaking after casting his vote at the Kericho polling station on Thursday, Keter commended the course of the exercise noting that it is by far the 'best nomination ever' further complementing supporters for upholding peace in the region. "I want to thank the party, I think this is the best ever organized nominations exercise since I joined politics," said Keter. "It has been a smooth election, there are no tensions at all in Kericho. I really want to thank the voters of Kericho, the turnout is perfect and they are exercising their democratic right at the right environment." He further called on the party National Elections Board (NEB) to remain unbiased while supervising the exercise up to its completion. He urged all the aspirants across the country to accept the outcome, remaining confident that he will clinch the Kericho governorship seat ticket. "I want to thank the National Elections Board in the management of the elections and I want to urge them to be impartial," stated Keter. "Its a question of a few hours, by 6 or 7 the winner will be announced and of course its me by the look of things. All of us who are participating should accept the verdict of what will happen." However, there have been delays reported in various polling stations, scattered across the country. In Bomet, rigging claims marred the exercise after several aspirants, among them Wilson Sossion who is seeking the UDA ticket for the senator seat claimed they had intercepted suspicious, unsecured ballot boxes and ballot papers. Elsewhere in Kisii, there was an issue of shortage of ballot boxes but the hitch had already been sorted out. UDA National Elections Board (NEB) Chairman Anthony Mwaura has meanwhile exuded confidence that the primaries were going on as scheduled, saying the only hiccups witnessed were logistical challenges that had already been resolved.
