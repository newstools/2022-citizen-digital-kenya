Roots Party leader and Presidential flagbearer Professor George Wajackoyah has urged his supporters to vote for ODM leader
Raila Odinga if not him. Speaking at a campaign
in Kisumu on Monday, Wajackoyah said that he had been sent by Raila, and that he has a game plan with the Azimio la Umoja presidential candidate. “Agwambo has sent
me, he has told me where to and where not to go. Raila has allowed me to go ahead
until when we get victory. If you don’t vote for me then you would
rather vote for him.  A victory for
either of us will be a win,” Wajackoyah said in Dholuo dialect. Wajackoyah said that awin for himself or Raila Odinga will benefit the Western Kenya and Nyanza
region. “You will all be rich,
everyone will have enough bhang, build their own church,” he said. In the rally, Wajackoyah
drummed up support for Raila Odinga and dismissed William Ruto’s presidential
bid. Last week, Jubilee
Party Deputy National Chairperson David Murathe saidthat the Azimio coalition is contemplating having Wajackoyah’s bhang legalizationreforms as part of its manifesto. “We are asking him to consider
in the next dispensation… for medicinal purposes because the numbers Wajackoyah
is giving are making sense,” said Murathe.  Adding, “It is not your normal
weed. This is medicinal... You are not telling us to grow weed in Galana or
Mwea instead of food security, I like it in theory.”
