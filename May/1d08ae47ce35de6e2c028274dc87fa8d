  The residents led by South Sakwa ward representative Ken Ouma now want police to swiftly identify the engineer’s alleged killers on grounds that the puzzling incident has caused unrest in the area. . Ouma has also urged police to heighten night patrol in the region in a bid to improve security adding that members of the public should also work closely with the security officers to weed the perpetrators of such cases. Confirming the incident, Migori County police commander Mark Wanjala told Radio Ramogi he was confident that police would identify the culprits after launching investigations into the incident. Following preliminary investigations, police are of the opinion that the victim was killed at another location before his body was dumped outside the hospital. Detectives had yet to identify any persons of interest by the time of publishing.  Wanjala has consequently appealed to Awendo residents to work closely with police to curb rising cases of insecurity in the region.
