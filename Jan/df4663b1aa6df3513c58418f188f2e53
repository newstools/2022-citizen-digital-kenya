 Eight
Chinese nationals who were last week arrested by Directorate of Criminal
Investigations (DCI) and Immigration sleuths for working without business
permits have been arraigned in court. All
eight suspects were slapped with a Ksh.50,000 fine and ordered to regularize
their immigration status. “They were each fined Ksh.50,000
and issued with a stern warning against engaging in work without permits by the
CMs Court Nairobi,” said the National Police Service (NPS) in a tweet on Saturday. The
eight, Xie Liguang, Zhang Liyi, Cong Tingting, Qiao Liuping, Zhang Tili, Long
Yujie and Liu Rong were arrested at Ur Home International Kenya along
Mombasa Road on January 14 where they were selling tiles and furniture. NPS
has since urged employers to demand necessary documents from immigrant workers
should they decide to hire them in any capacity. “We caution employers that it is illegal
for any foreigner to work in Kenya without a valid work permit,” stated the
service
