Samburu Governor Moses Lenolkulal has
officially joined Deputy President William Ruto‘s campaign team in the Kenya
Kwanza coalition ahead of the August General Elections. Lenolkulal, who was eyeing the Samburu Senatorial
seat, has also shelved his ambitions in favor of incumbent Steve Lelegwe who is
running on a United Democratic Alliance (UDA) party ticket. DP Ruto made the announcement on Tuesday as
he welcomed the Samburu County boss into his camp, accompanied by other UDA
members. “We welcome Samburu Governor Moses Lenolkulal
to the Kenya Kwanza presidential campaign team,” DP Ruto wrote on Twitter. “He has graciously vacated his senatorial
aspiration for Steve Lelegwe who will be defending his Samburu seat in the
August 9 General Election.” DP Ruto was in the company of his Kenya
Kwanza co-principal Ford-Kenya party leader Moses Wetangula, Governors Josphat
Nanok (Turkana), Martin Wambora (Embu), Mutahi Kahiga (Nyeri) as well as
Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa.  The outgoing governor, who is serving his
second and final term, was elected on a Jubilee Party ticket.
