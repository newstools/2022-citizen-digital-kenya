President Uhuru Kenyatta has congratulated
Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka for shelving his presidential ambitions to
back ODM leader Raila Odinga in the August race to State House. The President, speaking on
Saturday during Azimio la Umoja’s National Delegates Convention (NDC) at KICC,
termed Musyoka’s move as a heroic act of selflessness. “Wengi wameweka kando tamaa ama
ambitions zao kwa sababu wanataka kuona Kenya ikishkana, mmoja wao akiwa ndugu
yangu Kalonzo Musyoka,” said President Kenyatta. “Ameweka tamaa yake chini kwa
kulilia taifa la Kenya…nataka tusimamame tumpigie makofi kwa sababu ya ushujaa
wake. Tunamshukuru na tunamwambia asante sana.” The Head of State further renewed his support
for Odinga’s presidential bid, terming him as the perfect candidate to steer
the country into development and a corruption-free state. “Sina shaka ya kwamba ana uwezo.
Ako na nia, na Mwenyezi Mungu atamjalia aweze kuhakikisha ya kwamba taifa letu la
Kenya litasonga mbele na maendeleo, kupigana na ufisadi na liwe taifa linaheshimika
duniani. I am very confident of that,” he said. While hailing those who had
joined hands in support of Odinga under the Azimio La Umoja movement, President
Kenyatta promised that there will be a place for all of them in Odinga’s
government. “Nina hakika kuwa wakati ataingia
usukani, hatawacha ndugu na dada zake nyuma. Wakati serikali itaundwa, utasikia
Kalonzo Musyoka, Gideon Moi, Charity Ngilu, Alfred Mutua,” he said. “Tumekubaliana kuwa tutaketi
naye, na Kalonzo, na wale wengine ndio tuamue wale wengine wa line up hiyo
watakuwa kina nani watashikana pamoja kuunda serikali mwezi wa nane ukifika.” Saturday’s convention saw over 20 political
parties; among them Wiper, KANU, DAP-K and Maendeleo Chap Chap, sign an agreement
to officially join Azimio la Umoja movement.
