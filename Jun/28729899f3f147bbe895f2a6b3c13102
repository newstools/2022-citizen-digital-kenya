 The delay, according to Chebukati, was caused by concerns raised by audit firm KPMG about 1.18 million voter records that could be deactivated. The one million includes voters who have died, those who have duplicate records, and those who may have registered using IDs that do not belong to them. In a report, KPMG noted that there were 246,465 deceased voters, 481,711 duplicate records, and 226,143 voters who registered with fake IDs. It also revealed that 164,269 people were registered with voter records with invalid identification documents (IDs and Passports). "These issues must now be addressed prior to certification and publication of the register," noted Chebukati at a press briefing on Wednesday. KPMG Head of Advisory Gerald Kasimu says they noticed some difficulties in the voter registration process, implying that there are more issues that need to be investigated. He questioned the voter registration process's integrity as well as the voter register's hosting. "There are still quite a number of recommendations that we have provided in relation to the anomalies articulated that must be dealt with before a final register of voters can be gazetted and submitted to the public," Kasimu noted. "We've also noted a few of other control gaps from the review of the voter registration processes, the underlying systems on which the register of voters is hosted which will require some rectification as well in readiness for the election." This now means that IEBC must delay in publishing the final voters register until it addresses the audit report in full. The final voters register will now be delayed until June 20 and not on June 9, 2022 as earlier communicated. Meanwhile, both the Kenya Kwanza and Azimio la Umoja presidential candidates have raised concerns over the voters register, with IEBC promising to inform on status as soon as the KPMG report is in and implemented.
