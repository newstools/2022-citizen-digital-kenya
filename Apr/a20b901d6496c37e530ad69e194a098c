Multiple
people were shot and 13 people were hospitalized in an incident at a Brooklyn subway station during Tuesday morning rush hour,
authorities said. A
preliminary investigation shows a possible smoke device was detonated at the
station, according to a senior law enforcement official. The NYPD said that
there were no active explosive devices at this time. The incident began at about 8:30 a.m. when the Fire
Department of New York was called to the 36th Street subway station in
Brooklyn's Sunset Park neighborhood for a report of smoke. Two
sources said that five people were shot. A male suspect possibly
wearing a gas mask and orange construction vest fled the scene, police said,
citing a preliminary report. Police
told the public to avoid the area of 36th Street and 4th Avenue in Brooklyn,
where a large presence of emergency responders gathered. The shooting comes amid a rise in shootings in New York
over the past two years and a particular rise in violence on the subway that
has become a focus of Mayor Eric Adams' administration. There have been 617
crime complaints so far this year on the transit system, a 68% increase from
this point last year, NYPD data shows. The
Sunset Park neighborhood is located in the southwest corner of Brooklyn and is
home to a Chinatown and Latin American areas. All schools in the nearby
Brooklyn area are on a "shelter in," which a DOE spokesperson
explained means no one is allowed to leave the building, and only students are
allowed in. Adams,
who has Covid-19, has been briefed on the situation, his spokesperson Fabien
Levy said. "While
we gather more information, we ask New Yorkers to stay away from this area for
their safety and so that first responders can help those in need and
investigate," Levy said on Twitter.  The
Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the subways, says they
are also investigating the incident and that D, N and R trains are holding in
both directions in Brooklyn.
