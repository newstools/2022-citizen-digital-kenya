 Sonko says that IEBC’s decision to block him from seeking the Mombasa gubernatorial seat is un-procedural, unlawful and inconsistent. “That there is an urgent need for the court to review its orders so that the ends of justice are sought,” the embattled politician says in court papers seen by Citizen Digital. He further argues that the Wafula Chebukati-led electoral body’s decision to bar him from contesting in the General Election was actuated by bias, ill motive, malice and bad faith. He says that every action taken by IEBC disqualifies him from vying is unlawful. “The applicants' impeachment proceedings have not been concluded and are currently pending before the Supreme Court,” argues Sonko Sonko says that he has used a lot of money and committed immensely towards the Mombasa County political campaigns and barring him from contesting is against his fundamental rights. Similarly, he claims that his supporters stand to be affected.
