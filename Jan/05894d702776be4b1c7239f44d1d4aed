 Abubakar
Amana, a religious leader from Lamu, was on Wednesday interrogated by the
police and officers from the National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC)
over alleged incitement. According
to Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Noordin Haji, Amana uttered remarks
believed to have partly led to a flare up of skirmishes in the region. Amana
surrendered to authorities in Mombasa eight days after DPP Haji ordered that he
be investigated for alleged incitement. The
DPP claimed Amana was allegedly captured on a viral video referring to certain
parts of Kenya belonging to a particular tribe, therefore allegedly inciting
voters on tribal basis before the 2022 election. His
lawyer Yusuf Abubakar however said the utterances were taken out of context. “We have analysed the video clip and we have seen
nothing alarming about that…it is taken out of context, this is why we’re
confident…we want to exonorate our client of any criminal charges against him,”
said Abubakar. The
DPP said the alleged utterances could have incited hatred, hostility, violence
or discrimination contrary to Article 33 of the Constitution. Peter Njeru, the Coast Deputy Regional Police Commander,
said: “The utterances that he made were likely to fuel some contempt,
hostility, and could cause violence and discrimination against the people
living in Lamu.” Amana
is said to have fled to neighboring Tanzania on learning of the impending
arrest but his lawyers and family maintain he had gone to seek medical
attention. Rishard, his brother, stated: “Almost 30 police units
walikuja nyumbani Kwa Mzee Abubakar early in the morning tukashtuka sana kwa
sababu tunavyojua sheria ya nchi ikiwa kuna jambo lolote mtu anatakikana anakuwa
summoned…na mzee wetu hajakuwa summoned, wala hajamkosea mtu.”  Investigative
agencies say they will be issuing summons on need basis for futher interrogation
as investigations continue.
