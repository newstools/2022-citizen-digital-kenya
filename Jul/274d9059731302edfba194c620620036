 Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya said that ODM, Jubilee and Wiper parties alongside other outfits in the coalition have stepped up campaigns to get voters into voting for their parliamentary candidates so that they can have numerical strength in both Houses to run government business and implement Odinga's manifesto. Addressing a campaign rally in Butere sub county, Oparanya added that parliament will be critical to delivery of Odinga's promises to Kenyans that is why their agenda is to win majority seats in the August general elections. He expressed fear that if Kenya Kwanza garnered majority parliamentary seats they will frustrate implementation if Odinga's agenda, asking voters  to rally behind all Azimio candidates. Oparanya, who was appointed by Odinga as Finance Cabinet designate said that his agenda if he assumes the docket would be to reorganize the National budget to capture all the promises that Odinga gave Kenyans including free education, Health Insurance for all, the 6,000 stipend for the poor and support to all single mothers among others. He added that the budget must be approved by parliament and that is why they have upped their campaigns to bag more MPs. Oparanya also faulted delay in release of funds to counties by national government, saying the move has paralysed services at the devolved units. He said Kakamega county has not received Sh1.3 billion for the month of June from the national Treasury adding that as a result the county cannot undertake it's financial activities.
