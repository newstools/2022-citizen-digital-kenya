 According to Matiang'i, officers assigned to the operation have been aggressive in the mop up exercise which began on May 2, 2022, when a dusk-to-dawn curfew was imposed, to help tame the rising banditry cases in the county. Matiang'i said after a meeting with security officials in Marsabit on Monday that officers will not ease up on the disarmament exercise until the illegal guns and ammunition are recovered. "We want to thank our officers because for the past one month they have been here we have not heard any worrysome incidences. So far over 200 guns and 3,000 bullets have been recovered from this operation," Matiang'i noted.. "We hope more work will be done so that we can recover more guns because from the intelligence that we have, there are more guns out there from the ones we have collected. We will review this when we have around 3000 guns, there are still many guns in the wrong hands." Mr.Matiang'i expressed optimism about calming the escalating violence in the coming month, when a review will be conducted. One of the enforcements to be reviewed is the dusk-to-dawn curfew. "I'm very optimistic that we will get all the guns we need and ultimately keep this place peaceful," Matiang'i noted. "We will review the operation in the next few weeks and subject to the performance we will have we will review the current regulations put in place." The operation, however, will continue until the election period ends, according to Matiang'i, to ensure the region remains peaceful. "We have promised that we will not end the operations until after the general elections because this place has to be peaceful during campaigns, during and after elections." According to Matiang'i, police and administrative officers have agreed to take a more aggressive approach over the next month, including increased screening of individuals and communal engagement with members of the public to ensure that they are involved in decision-making.
