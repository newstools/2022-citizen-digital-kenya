Ukrainian forces have struck a
strategically important bridge in the southern part of the country, using what
a Russia-appointed official said were rocket systems supplied by the United
States. The Antonivskyi Bridge crossing
the Dnieper River was closed Wednesday following the Ukrainian strike. Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of
the Russia-appointed administration for the Kherson region, said the bridge was
still standing after the late Tuesday strike, but that the road deck was full
of holes. Stremousov said Ukrainian forces
used the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) to carry out the
strike. The bridge is a key link allowing
Russia to supply its forces in southern Ukraine. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy highlighted the bridge strikes in a
tweet Wednesday, saying Russian forces should take them as a warning. Podolyak said the Russians
“should learn how to swim across” the river or “leave Kherson while it is still
possible.”
