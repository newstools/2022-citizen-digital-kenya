Deputy
President William Ruto's presidential campaign team has called out ODM leader Raila Odinga for
supposedly not committing to whole-heartedly accepting the results of the
upcoming presidential elections. In
a statement to newsrooms on Thursday, the DP’s Director of Communications Hussein Mohammed
highlighted how the former premier relayed obscure conditions for the
acceptance of the election results when he made an address at Chatham House in
London on Wednesday. “He
was categorical that only "IF" the election is free and fair and he
wins or loses will he accept the result,” the statement reads in part. “The
fairness or lack of, in an election is not and cannot be determined by any
candidate's subjective opinion of the results. Kenya has institutions to
determine the validity of the election.” Mohammed
also touched on the disputed 2017 presidential elections underlining how the ODM leader had
moved to hold the country at ransom when he decided to swear himself in as the
people’s president after being floored by President Uhuru Kenyatta at the
polls. This,
Mohammed claimed, highlights just how far the ODM leader can go should he decide
to boycott the election results. He
similarly stated that DP Ruto has audibly committed to accepting the results
should he fall short at the ballot. “UDA
Presidential Candidate Dr William Ruto has committed to and continues to
unequivocally challenge his competitors to UNCONDITIONALLY commit to accepting
the August 2022 Presidential election results and submit to existing
institutional frameworks. No 'BUT'S', No 'IF'S'.” “This
commitment and guarantee should be made to Kenyans and the rule of law must
always prevail,” reads the statement.
