Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party leader
Raila Odinga has now vowed to address the water, land and infrastructural issues
plaguing the Coastal region if he clinches the presidency in the forthcoming August
polls. Odinga, speaking during his tour of the region
on Saturday, said he understood the woes of the region and is well-placed to solve
them. He recalled his tenure as the country’s prime
minister during which, he said, himself and then president Mwai Kibaki had a
well-outlined plan of putting an end to the water shortages in the region to
combat drought. The former premier said that if he succeeds President
Uhuru Kenyatta in August, he will prioritize setting up dams and come up with a
water distribution system to ensure the locals and their animals easily access
water sources without necessarily trekking long distances. “Hapa kwenu shida
zote sisi tunazijua; kwanza maji. Yale mengine ni mambo ya ardhi. Hayo yote
sisi tunajua. Maji yakikosekana, ukame inakuja ikifuatana na njaa. Ni mpaka
tupate suluhu ile ya kudumu,” Odinga said. “Tulipokua kwa
serikali, mimi na Kibaki tulichora mambo ya kuleta mabwawa hapa kubwa ili mvua
wakati ule inanyesha, tunavuna maji ili wakati wa ukame nyinyi mnatumia hayo
maji.” He added: “Tulisema tutaleta mifereji karibu na miji mahali watu wanaishi ili
akina mama wasiende mbali kutafuta maji na ndiposa mifugo isikose maji. Hiyo
itaweza kufanyika na itakuwa our first priority.” Consequently, the Azimio la Umoja leader
promised to ensure that the infrastructural sector in the region was revamped,
citing his experience in the roads ministry. "Mimi nilikua
waziri wa barabara na ujenzi. Mipango yote ya barabara zote zilizo hapa
zilichorwa wakati wangu nikiwa waziri; upande wa miundo msingi tutatengeneza
kabisa," he said.  Odinga similarly reassured Coast residents that
he would roll out his agenda with a focus on the health and education sectors
as well as dealing with unemployment as a means to eradicating poverty.
