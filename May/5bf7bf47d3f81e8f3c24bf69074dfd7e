 Mutua, in response to several publications claiming to have information that he had expressed interest in the MP seat, stated that he will not be running for any elective office in August. "For avoidance of doubt, I wish to clarify that at this particular time, I am not running for any elective position in the forthcoming elections. I am concentrating on campaigning for the Kenya Kwanza coalition so that Kenya can get a new system where dreams can come true," Mutua Tweeted on Monday. The outspoken governor, who recently joined the Kenya Kwanza faction, says he will now devote all of his efforts to campaigning for the DP Ruto-led coalition. Mutua, who had previously touted himself as a viable presidential candidate, was a member of Raila's Azimio One Kenya Coalition, but would leave on May 9 after severing ties with the coalition over a number of issues, including his frustration in trying to access or understand the coalition agreement his party had signed. “As a party we had been excluded from Azimio line-ups, campaign programs and funding. We have also not been shown, or even allowed to discuss what our roles would be after the elections,” said Mutua.
