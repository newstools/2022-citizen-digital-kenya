Nandi Hills Member of Parliament Alfred Keter
has won the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) party ticket to defend his seat in
the August polls. Keter managed to secure victory in
the Deputy President William Ruto-led party after  flooring his competitors
to clear him for the race. In the contest that had been
postponed following the death of an aspirant in a road accident,
the lawmaker garnered 10,273 votes ahead of Kitur Benard Kibor who
got 7,468 votes. Chepkwony Robert Kipkorir emerged third after
bagging 2,513 votes, followed by Limo Abraham Kipkoech (540), George Tarus (425),
Chemtai Irene (388), and Lelei Lilian Cherotich (160).  Wesley Kogo, a UDA aspirant for the
same seat, died in a road accident in Kangemi, Nairobi on April 7.
