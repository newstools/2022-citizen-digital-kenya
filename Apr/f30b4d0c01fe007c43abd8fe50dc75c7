The United Democratic Alliance (UDA) party
disciplinary committee has summoned Norman Nyaga and John Muchiri to appear
before it following violence and burning of electoral materials on the eve of
party primaries in Embu County. The committee, in a letter to the two on
Wednesday, cited a complaint filed against them relating to the arson and
destruction of party poll materials as well as incitement of the public outside
The Izaak Walton Inn. “The party is seized with video footage as
well as information, material and other evidence which links you with the
aforementioned criminal activity in gross violation of the Party Constitution
and Code of Conduct,” read the letter signed by Paul Karuga. “Further, be informed that if the accusations
against you as herein above specified are proved at the hearing, the
consequences thereof are grave and include disqualification from participating
in the nomination process, suspension or even expulsion from the Party.” The two leaders are now required to appear
before the committee on Saturday at 9a.m for the hearing of the matter at the
Hustlers Centre in Nairobi.  “In accordance with Article 29.1 you may
represent yourself in person or you may bring along another member of the Party
to represent you provided that such representative is a UDA party member or an
Advocate of the High Court of Kenya,” added the letter. This
comes after a lorry transporting ballot material to Embu County ahead of the UDA
party’s primaries slated for Thursday was on Wednesday ransacked by rowdy youth
who set the material on fire. The
youth, reports say, tracked the lorry from Mbeere South, which is 15 kilometres
away from Embu, to Izaak Walton Hotel, where they pillaged the material and set
it ablaze.  The
Deputy President William Ruto-led party has since dispatched Elgeyo Marakwet
Senator Kipchumba Murkomen, Sigowet-Soin MP Bernard Koros and his Tharaka
counterpart Gitonga Muragara to help deal with the situation.
