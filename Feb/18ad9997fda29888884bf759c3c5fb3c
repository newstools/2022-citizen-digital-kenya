Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka maintains he is
in the race for president even as his party’s National Executive Council (NEC)
mandated him to negotiate partnerships with other like-minded parties. This came after a day’s long NEC sitting at
the Wiper party headquarters, Nairobi, that saw leaders drawn from across the
country deliberate on the political future of the party. Party Secretary General Shakila Abdallah
outlined the party's resolution as: “We have mandated the party leader and his
partners to continue negotiating with like-minded leaders in order to form the
next government.” The blessing to the former vice president to
engage in coalition talks, however, came with terms and conditions. “Kuna wale wengine mnafika kwa meza,
wanazungumza na wewe na wameficha mengine… you cannot negotiate with a weapon in
your arms…this is what it is, sincere, open, transparent negotiations in good
faith,” said Kalonzo. Asked whether the One Kenya Alliance (OKA)
will team up with the Raila Odinga-led outfit Azimio la Umoja, Kalonzo hinted
to a possibility. “We’re going for nothing less than the
presidency, that is the mandate I was given in Kasarani…so I will not allow
anyone to dilute that position for me,” he said. Kalonzo also pointed out that when parties
come together the country is spared from post election expenses. “I met someone who thinks this is the moment
for Kenya to go for a runoff and what happens..but if on the other hand we
cannot do a runoff because wengine watakuibia ata kabla ya kuanza, then lazima
ujikakamue sasa ujue kama utaenda mbele ama utarudi nyuma,” he said. The leaders intimated that OKA has been
approached for a possible coalition with other parties.
