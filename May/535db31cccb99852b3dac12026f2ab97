The United Democratic Alliance (UDA) party chairman
Johnson Muthama does not see himself sitting at the same table with Machakos Governor
Alfred Mutua anytime soon,  this is despite
the Maendeleo Chap Chap chief’s Monday move to join him in the Deputy President
William Ruto-led Kenya Kwanza Alliance. While explaining his absence from a Kenya
Kwanza alliance rally held in Tala, Machakos County on Tuesday, Muthama
revealed that he and Mutua do not see eye-to-eye politically, which is what informed
his decision to snub the event. "Niliamua kutohudhuria mkutano ya jana
kwa sababu ya mambo fulani. Kwanza mimi na Mutua tuna shida na si shida ya
kibinafsi, ni shida ya uongozi," Mutua said in a KTN News interview on
Wednesday night. Muthama went on to castigate Governor Mutua
for allegedly making empty promises to the people of Machakos County and taking
credit for projects he has yet to undertake and implement. According to Muthama, Governor Mutua pledged
that he would better the fortunes of Machakos residents when he entered office
but has allegedly failed to keep any of his promises. "Mutua alizunguka akisema amewekea watu
wa Machakos maji na hakuna ata maji ameweka na hizo pesa alitenga kufanya huo
mradi haijulikani ilipo. Alisema atajenga water dams lakini hakuna dam
ametengeneza,” he said. “Alitangaza kwamba amenunua matingatinga za
kusaidia wakulima lakini hakuna mtu amelimiwa. Nyumba ya polisi hazijejengwa,
cameras za kusaidia na usalama pia hajeweka.” Despite the stark political differences
between himself and Mutua, Muthama underscored that he was not against the
Machakos Governor joining the Kenya Kwanza alliance and drumming up support for
DP Ruto ahead of the August polls. "Mimi napokea kuja kwa Mutua kama
mwanakenya aliyeamua kujiunga na UDA. Mimi ni kushirikiana na UDA chini ya
Kenya Kwanza kama vile chama vingine na sioni matatatizo makubwa au shida juu
ya hiyo," he said. "Shida si Mutua kuja Kenya Kwanza, ako
na ruhusa ya kumfanyia naibu wa rais siasa yake na kumpigia kura lakini
mimi mwenyewe kama Muthama nitasema haujafika wakati wa kunywa chai na Mutua,
wala wa kufanya campaign na yeye." The Machakos Governor aspirant however hinted
that he was ready to make peace and share the same podium with Mutua if the
incumbent governor owns up to his alleged infractions.  "Ikiwa tutakaa na yeye na kuzungumza na
akubali kwenda mbele ya watu wa Machakos na kusema haya ni ya kweli na naomba
msamaha, hapo nitatembea na Mutua," he said.
