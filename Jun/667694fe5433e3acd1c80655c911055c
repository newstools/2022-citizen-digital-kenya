 Now in its second year, ​​the ACCER Awards are an initiative of the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA), Africa’s largest coalition of civil society groups, faiths and community based organisations, academia, researchers and individuals who advocate for fair and just climate regimes for African people. According to the ACCER Award judges, Ms. Muigai and Ms. Oloo were judged as having presented entries which met criteria as set by the call for entries and were within the thematic areas that the ACCER Planning Committee had set. The two were selected out of a pool of 22 entries submitted in the TV category. “As expected, the quality of entries were many and our team had to put their best feet forward in deciding who the finalists are. It was an exercise that needed patience, back and forth engagement and making hard decisions,” Prof Kioko Ireri, who chaired the seven-judge bench, said. Winners will receive their awards and prizes at an Award Gala Night before the international audience in Kigali, Rwanda in the sidelines of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) on June 23. Initiated in 2013, the main objective of the ACCER Awards is to recognize African journalists who excel in environmental journalism. The goal and inherent intention of ACCER is not only to reshape the African narrative as espoused in Climate Change and Environment debates but also to build a new culture of and consciousness on how we utilize biological resources in our environment and reduce our carbon footprint.
