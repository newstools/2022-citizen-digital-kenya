 Downplaying the outfit’s ongoing exercise of reviewing before selecting a suitable candidate to deputize flag-bearer Raila Odinga in his August presidential bid, Senator Mutula said Kalonzo is undoubtedly the perfect suit for the role. “Kalonzo can't do the exam while he is the marking scheme,” said the senator while speaking in Wote, Makueni County during the party’s tour of the region. “We have said Kalonzo won't attend the interview on Monday, if the chance is given to any other person, kitaumana,” he added. According to Mutula, the Azimio Running-mate Selection Panel is planning to compromise Kalonzo's fate so that he ends up as Speaker in an Odinga administration, a post he says should be reserved for former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth instead. “No vetting was done for Kalonzo to be vice president, they want Kalonzo to be the speaker but that should be given to Peter Kenneth. No kalonzo no Raila!” The senator further defended former Nairobi governor Mike Sonko’s decision to run for Mombasa County’s top seat under a Wiper ticket, saying he is justified under the law to run anywhere he wishes. “The law allows Mike mbuvi Sonko to vie anywhere, Uhuru and Ruto were ICC suspects and they stood for presidency, so sonko has a right to stand,” said Mutula. So far, the selection panel has shortlisted several candidates from a list of 20 applicants, among them Musyoka, Sabina Chege (Jubilee Party), Martha Karua (NARC Kenya), Charity Ngilu (NARC), Peter Kenneth (Jubilee Party) Gideon Moi (KANU) Ali Hassan Joho (ODM) and Stephen Kipkiyeny Torus (National Liberal Party). Others are Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya, deputy ODM leader Wyicliffe Oparanya an Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui.
