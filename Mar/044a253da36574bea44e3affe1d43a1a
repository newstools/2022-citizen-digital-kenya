 Mr. Owino who resigned from the civil service early last month is now going to battle for the ODM party ticket alongside Siaya Senator James Orengo, former banker Otieno Okanja, former United Nations official Bella Akinyi and advocate George Mugoye Mbeya. Speaking after he was officially received by ODM officials at the party’s Alego/Usonga branch office in Siaya town, Mr. Owino who has worked as a police officer for 29 years wished his competitors the best of luck but called for peaceful campaigns. Mr. Owino who exuded confidence of winning the party nominations to secure the party ticket, stated that he is now going to begin the campaigns strongly to sell his agenda for Siaya county. He stated that if elected the governor of Siaya County his vision is to make Siaya among the first counties in terms of development. He says that they are committed to ensure they have as many people as possible in the party and that the role to choose the flagbearer will squarely remain with the electorates.
