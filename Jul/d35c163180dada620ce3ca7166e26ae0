Economist David
Ndii is the campaign manager for Mwende Gatabaki-Ndii who is one of the
candidates vying for the Kiambu Governor seat in the upcoming August General
Election. Ndii personally
disclosed on Tuesday that he is actively involved in his wife's campaigns in
Kiambu County while at the same time playing his role as one of the strategists
in Deputy President William Ruto's presidential campaign. Responding to a
question from a viewer on whether he is involved in his wife's campaigns in
Kiambu, Ndii said: "Yes I am involved...totally. I'm her campaign
manager." Ndii, who is the
Head of the Kenya Kwanza coalition Policy and Programmes team, was speaking on
Citizen TV's News Night show. Speaking in a
recent media debate, Mwende Gatabaki, who is vying on a Safina Party ticket, promised that if elected Kiambu Governor,
she will focus on a three-pillar agenda, which includes empowering young people
economically, expanding smallholder agriculture, and reducing climate change. Born
and raised in Kiambu County, Gatabaki is the daughter of Senior Chief Peter Gatabaki of Thakwa who is also the former
Githunguri MP. She began working for the Kenya Tea Development
Agency (KTDA) in 2004 and held the position of ICT Group General Manager until
2010. Gatabaki
received a significant break in her career when President Uhuru Kenyatta hired
her in 2014 to be Director General at the Kenya Citizens and Foreign Nationals
Management Service (KCFNMS) and Chair the Presidential Digital Transformations
of Government. Later, she oversaw strategy development while working
for consulting firm McKinsey & Company as the Senior Public Sector Advisor
for East Africa. She was promoted to
Practice Leader at Lattice Consulting Limited in 2018. She currently serves as the
company's founder and managing director. Gatabaki will be
running against other well-known leaders for the top position in Kiambu,
including Senator Kimani Wamatangi, William Kabogo, and current incumbent James
Nyoro.
