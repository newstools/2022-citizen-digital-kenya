Six Mandera County MCAs on Saturday joined Deputy President
William Ruto’s United Democratic Alliance (UDA) party. DP Ruto received the six, Abdi Ali (Neboi), Abdinur Diisow (Elwak
South), Robow Mohammed Hassan (Lagure), Adan Haji (Takaba South), Ibrahim Ali
Wariyo (Shimbir Fatuma) and Shaban Hassan Hillow (Ashabito), at his official
Karen residence. Robow and Hillow are eyeing the Kamukunji and Banisa Parliamentary
seats at the August polls. The Hustler nation likewise added three Wajir County politicians
to its ranks. “Our formidable Kenya Kwanza team for Wajir County is now
complete. We welcome Shallow Abdulla (Senate), Prof Mohammed Elmi, (Deputy
Governor) and Nasri Sahal (Women Rep). We also welcome Nairobi nominated MCA
Nimo Omar Haji to the party,” DP Ruto tweeted. Kamau Ngotho, a political aspirant eyeing Ol Kalou’s Parliamentary
seat, also joined DP Ruto’s camp in what is sure to be a boost for the UDA
frontman whose party has been rocked with a number of defections in recent
days. On March 20, for instance, 50 Kirinyaga UDA officials, led by
former Kirinyaga Senator Daniel Karaba, severed ties with UDA and joined
President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Jubilee Party.  The officials were welcomed into the party by Interior PS Karanja
Kibicho at a ceremony held in Kagio, Kirinyaga County.
