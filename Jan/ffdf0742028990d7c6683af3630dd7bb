 The Ministry of Health says there is need to
match the amount of money that the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) is
paying for a patient and the amount of money that a hospital is charging for
particular services. Speaking during the launch of Afya Njema
programme at Jumuia hospitals in Huruma, Nairobi, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said
his ministry together with NHIF, private and faith-based hospitals are in talks
about charges on treatment for various diseases. According to the CS, the new plan will bring
equality in access to healthcare services in the country. Kagwe challenged public hospitals service
providers to follow their private counterparts in service delivery saying
equipment is no longer the difference but how they attend to their customers. “Kama NHIF inalipa elfu sita, na hospitali
inataka elfu tisa, tuseme wacha NHIF ilipe elfu saba na nyinyi mlipishe elfu
saba, mwananchi akija anatibiwa anaenda nyumbani bila kuulizwa chochote. That
is what is called affordable healthcare, it’s not magic,” said the CS.  NHIF Board Chairman Lewis Nguyai, on his
part, said: “I’m pleased and thankful to say that the president assented the
NHIF Amendment Act into law on December 27, 2021 and it is being published
this Friday in the Kenya gazette, and as such we’re now on a road which will
ensure that it will be mandatory contributions for the enrolment of all Kenyans
who are the years 18 and above.”
