 In a press statement on Friday, the Wiper Democratic Movement said that Kalonzo will not be presenting his documents to IEBC on June 4 as was earlier planned. The official withdrawal from the Presidential race comes a day after Kalonzo declared his support for the Azimio – OKA coalition candidate Raila Odinga. Speaking at a joint rally with coalition members on Thursday, Kalonzo said he made the decision to shelve his ambitions for the sake of the country. "I have come to the realisation that the future of our nation is on our shoulders. I have deferred my dreams to run in the August elections," he said. The Wiper Party leader also accepted the chief minister position that was allocated to him in the Azimio-OKA government structure. “I have decided to accept with humility and appreciation my nomination as Chief Minister in the Azimio coalition. It's not if we will win, but when we form the next government,” he said. He also congratulated Narc-Kenya Party leader Martha Karua for clinching the running mate position in the coalition, promising to support her. Kalonzo’s official withdrawal from the race means that he will not face IEBC in the ongoing vetting of Presidential candidates.
