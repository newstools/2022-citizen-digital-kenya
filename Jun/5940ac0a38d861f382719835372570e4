Wiper
Party leader Kalonzo Musyoka now says he will make a major announcement that he
claims will disrupt the political setting of the country in two days' time. Speaking
at the burial of former diplomat Joseph Katithi in Kyawango village in Mwala,
Machakos County on Wednesday, Kalonzo yet again gave a hint that he could be on
his way back to Azimio La Umoja One Kenya Alliance. Kalonzo's
move to pass messages of condolences from ODM Chief and Azimio presidential
candidate Raila Odinga and his running mate Martha Karua to the bereaved family
exposed his apparent plan to rejoin the Azimio coalition. The
Wiper leader urged the Kamba community to bear with him and support his political
move stating that it was in their best interest. "I
will give a political statement within two days’ time. That’s why I am
requesting the Kamba community to support my political move,” Kalonzo said. He
asked the region's leaders not to ridicule him once he makes the announcement
since he has the blessings of the Wiper party’s delegates. Senator
Enock Wambua on his part said that as far as they were concerned, all the
options for Kamba community were on the table and that they would not subject
the Kambas to humiliation from anyone or any community saying that where
Kalonzo will direct them that's where they would go. Wavinya
Ndeti added that Kalonzo was a National leader and Kambas were waiting for him
to show them the direction to take.
