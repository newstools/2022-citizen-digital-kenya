 As candidates finish preparing for national exams which kick off in six weeks, Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha has said that they will have special considerations for learners from areas that have been hit by insecurity during marking. Magoha, speaking at Mahiga Girls High School in Nyeri where he had gone to launch the construction of new CBC classes, said the government is considerate about how learning has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The CS has further assured that every candidate will sit their exams despite issues of insecurity in some regions in the country, adding that they are working with the Ministry of Interior to ensure the situation in Lamu is contained. On CBC transition, the CS said that the construction of classes is on course across the country while expressing optimism that they will meet the march deadline in the construction works.
